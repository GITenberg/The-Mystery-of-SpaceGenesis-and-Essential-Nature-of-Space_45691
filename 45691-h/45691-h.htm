<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>Mathematics is the biometer of intellectual evolution.
Hence, the determination of the <i>status quo</i>
of the intellect at any time can be accomplished most
satisfactorily by applying to it the rigorous measure
of the mathematical method. The intellect has but
one true divining rod and that is mathematics. By
day and by night it points the way unerringly, so long
as it leads through materiality; but, falteringly, blindly,
fatally, when that way veers into the territory of
vitality and spirituality.</p>

<p>Wherefore, when we have wished to ascertain the
real status of the intellect, as well as its limitations,
tendencies, possibilities, we have turned to its conduct
in the field of mathesis where it is least trammeled in
its ingressive and egressive motivations because of the
natural and easy accommodation which is offered for
intellectual movement. Whether there are signs of
moribundity or symptomatic evidences of marked
growth or of a termination of intellectual regnancy,
or whatever may be the occasion for the examination,
no surer index than the mathematical may be found
for the purpose. Full logical justification is, therefore,
claimed for the choice of mathematical evidences to
test the assumption that a new era of conscious mental
conquest is opening for the vanguard of humanity and
sequently for the human family.</p>

<p>The treatment of these evidences has fallen logically
into two divisions, namely, the first, a brief
and elementary review of the principles of the non-Euclidean
geometry and their bearings upon the question
of space as the subject of mathematical study;
and second, the consideration of space as a psychological,
vital and dynamic or creative phenomenon.</p>

<p>In Part I an effort has been made to trace the
growth of the notion of hyperspace and to show that
it is a symbol of a new epoch of intellectual expansion,
an actual seizure of a new domain of awareness by
the mind. And for this purpose a critical examination
of the fundamental question of dimensionality is
entered upon from which it develops that the status
of this primary norm of mathematical thought exhibits
a relatively inchoate character because of its insufficiency
as a definitive quantity, and further, because of
its rather superfoetated aspect when utilized as a
panacea for mathetic symptoms. Also, it has been
found necessary to survey the field of the four-space
which has been accorded such a prominent place in
the mathematical thought of the day. The reader
should find in the chapter devoted to it adequate material
for thought and sufficient comprehension of its
meanings as a mathematical contrivance.</p>

<p>In Part II an endeavor is made to interpret the
evidences offered by high mathematic considerations
in the light of the larger psychogenetic movement.
For this undertaking the quality of awareness has been
studied with the view to establishing its priority as a
determining agency in the consideration of space in
aspects broader and less restricted than those embraced
in the mathematical premises. Wherefore, it
appears that there are massive implications arising
out of the hyperspace propaganda which have hitherto
been neglected in the preliminaries incident to the
fabrication of its structure. A very brief, and more
or less symbolic, sketch of the genesis of space has
served to demonstrate its essential nature as a consubstantive
of materiality, vitality and intellectuality,
the three major objective processes. Consequently it
becomes imperatively necessary that any view of space
which neglects its kosmic intent and purpose should
be regarded as gravely fragmentary and insufficient.
It is only by linking up the two aspects of space, the
mathematical and the psychological, in such a manner
that the one shall supplement the other, that we shall
be able to arrive at a truly satisfactory understanding
of its nature.</p>

<p>In Chapter IX attention is invited to some of
the extremities of mathematical laws wherein it is
shown that, because mathematical goods are strictly
of intellectual texture and fabric, vain is the hope of
reaching any reliable certainty with respect to many
vital questions, even regarding space itself, by means
of the mathematical method. The intellect, and,
therefore, mathematics encounter the most formidable
stricture when effort is made to maneuver in the field
of vitality or realism. In addition, it is shown that,
when pushed to the utmost logical limits, metageometry
proves not only futile, but emphasizes the need for
a sharp turning of the path of search from the intellectual
or material to the spiritual or intuitional.
Indeed, it becomes painfully certain that the Golden
Fleece of profounder knowledge will be discovered
never by an expedition whose bark has its sails set
for the winds of mathematical seas. But, contrarily,
a new bark, moored at the furthermost shore of the
sea of intellectuality with sails set for the winds which
come from the realm of intuitional perception, must
be seized. Whereupon, by the straightest line, we
shall, at the last, land upon the shore of realism, of
truth all inclusive.</p>

<p>Mathematical evidences have been used in these
discussions because they, of all lines of knowledge,
afford a more just exemplification of intellectual evolution.
The science of mathematics is the measure of
the quality of intellectual growth and, therefore, its
data, its postulates, hypotheses and advances clearly
mark the stages of the intellectual movement.</p>

<p>Chapter X is the natural and logical sequence of
the inquiry into the question of spatiality. The conclusions
reached therein and the obvious inferences
which should be drawn from the arguments presented
flow inevitably not only from the evidences of mathematical
data but of the common observations of life.
And while we disclaim any intention of demanding
acceptance of them as final, authoritative declarations,
we shall be satisfied if the readers of this volume be
incited to solve for themselves the problems which
these queries naturally suggest. Happy indeed shall
be the outcome if there be any who, following the path
sketched herein, shall find the solution of the <i>Mystery
of Space</i> and apply its meanings to the enhancement
of the values of the intuitive life.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author esteems it a special obligation
of gratitude that he should here acknowledge
the debt which he owes to all of his friends who have
in any way assisted or encouraged him in the completion
of this work. Among those whom he is permitted
to thank in this way is Mr. <span class="smcap">James Rindfleisch</span>
who, having very kindly prepared the illustrations for
the photo-engravers, is deserving of special mention.</p>

<p>The following interpretation of words, phrases
and notions occurring in the text, and also biographical
sketches which the scope and purpose of the book itself
make it impracticable to elaborate, are appended with
the view to facilitating its perusal.</p>

<p>AT-ONE-MENT (state of unity, unitariness); denotes
the ultimate state of oneness towards which all evolutionary
movement tends; applied to consciousness, indicates the final
expansion of consciousness wherein it coincides with the universal
consciousness in extent and quality of comprehension. As
applied to things, denotes the unification of all movements,
tendencies, and evolutions as a singularity; the end of all evolutionary
activity (vide p. 270).</p>

<p>BELTRAMI, EUGENIO, was born at Cremona, November
16, 1835; there he attended the elementary schools, the
gymnasium and the lyceum, excepting the scholastic year
1848-49 when he was at the Gymnasium of Venice, now known
as Marco Polo. He finished his lyceal studies in the summer of
1853, and in the following autumn (November) became a
student in the <i>Mathematical Faculty of the University of
Pavia</i>, after having obtained a scholarship there on the Castiglioni
Foundation in the <i>Collegio Ghisleri</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1854, the succeeding year, he was expelled from this
college in company with five of his colleagues who were accused
of promoting "disorders" against the Abbot <span class="smcap">Leonardi</span>,
rector of the college. The expulsion brought him many hardships
and disappointments, and for two years he drifted along
merely existing as his family was too poor to have him matriculated
at another university. But in 1856, he went to Verona
where he succeeded in securing employment as secretary to the
engineer, <span class="smcap">Diday</span>, in the Government service of Lombardy-Venice.
On January 10, 1857, he was dismissed from this
position "for political reasons"; but as the annexation of Lombardy
to Piedmont occurred soon thereafter, he became again
attached to the office of <span class="smcap">Diday</span>, his former employer, when it
was transferred to Milan as a consequence of political changes.</p>

<p>At Milan <span class="smcap">Beltrami</span> took up his mathematical education in
real earnest as he now had access to Professor <span class="smcap">Brioschi</span>, his
former tutor, and also <span class="smcap">Luigi Cremona</span>. Through the influence
of these two men he was designated (October 18, 1862) "Professore
straordinario" in the University of Bologna. His work
on <i>Surfaces of Constant Negative Curvature</i>, as the pseudosphere,
and his application of the expression given by <span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>
(q.v.) for the angle of parallelism, very definitely
secure for him a place among the foremost workers in the field
of the non-Euclidean geometry. He postulated a theorem,
known as <i>Beltrami's Theorem</i>, which he stated as follows:
"The center of a circle circumscribing a triangle is the center
of gravity of the centers of its inscribed and escribed circles."
He died in the year 1900. (Vide <i>Amer. Math. Mo.</i>, Vol. IX,
p. 59.)</p>

<p>BOLYAI, JANOS (1802-1860), was born at Kleansenburg,
Hungary. He is said to have inherited his mathematical
genius from his father, <span class="smcap">Bolyai Farkas</span> (1775-1856), who was
born at Bolya, Hungary. Being a very spirited youth, his
progress in his studies was most remarkable. He completed
the curriculum at the Latin school when only twelve years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
age. Was graduated from the Philosophical Curriculum as a
result of two years of study and then entered the Viennese
Academy of Engineers. Was appointed lieutenant at Temesvárlin,
1823, whence on November 3, 1823, he wrote his
father: "I have discovered such magnificent things that I am
myself astonished at them. It would be damage eternal if
they were lost. When you see them, my father, you yourself
will acknowledge it. Now, I cannot say more, only so much:
that from nothing I have created another wholly new world."
This letter was written in the Magyar language and has been
preserved at the Marcos Vásárhely, Hungary. The mathematical
conceptions formulated by him became the appendix of
the <i>Tentamen</i>, a book which his father had written on the
Theory of Parallels.</p>

<p>His <i>Science Absolute of Space</i> was translated into the
French in 1868 by the French mathematician, <span class="smcap">J. Hoüel</span>, to
whom belongs the credit of popularizing the works both of
<span class="smcap">Bolyai</span> and <span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>. (Vide <i>Science</i>, n. s., Vol. 35,
No. 906, 1912.)</p>

<p>CAYLEY, ARTHUR, born at Richmond, Surrey, England,
August 16, 1821; studied at King's College school;
entered Trinity College, Cambridge, already a well equipped
mathematician at the age of seventeen. When but twenty-one
years of age he took two of the highest honors in the University
of Cambridge. He was Senior Wrangler and First
Smith's Prizeman. He published his first paper in 1841 and
this was followed by eight hundred memoirs.</p>

<p>For fourteen years he practiced as Conveyancer. In 1863
Lady <span class="smcap">Sadler's</span> various trusts were consolidated, and a new
Sadlerian professorship of Pure Mathematics was created for
the express purpose of affording a place for Cayley. Meanwhile,
as early as 1852 he was a fellow of the Royal Society;
in 1858 he joined <span class="smcap">Sylvester</span> and <span class="smcap">Stokes</span> in publishing the
<i>Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics</i>.</p>

<p>He was for a considerable time principal adviser as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
merits of all mathematical papers which were presented for
publication to the Royal Society, the Astronomical Society, the
Mathematical Society and the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
He is said to have been the "most learned and erudite of mathematicians,"
and much of the material, therefore, which now
constitutes the basis of the non-Euclidean geometry is due to
his laborious efforts and comprehensive knowledge of mathematics.
(Vide <i>Review of Reviews</i>, Vol. II, 1895, Sketch, reprinted
from <i>Monist</i>.)</p>

<p>CHAOGENY (Gr. Chaos, disorder, geny&mdash;generating,
evolution); the evolution of chaos into order. A kosmic process
involving the elaboration of the original, formless world-plasm
into the first faint signs of orderliness; the beginnings
of the movement of life or the Creative Logos in preparation
of the field of evolution.</p>

<p>CHAOMORPHOGENY (Gr. Chaos, disorder&mdash;Morphe,
form&mdash;geny, becoming, generating); evolution of the space-form,
the universe; the establishment of the metes and bounds
of the universe; also, the origination and characterization of all
forms as to tendence, purpose and limitations.</p>

<p>CONCEPTUALIZATION&mdash;The act of conceptualizing,
the formulation of concepts; the process by which the Thinker
arrives at concepts; the logical procedure by which the consistency
of a scheme of thought is established.</p>

<p>CONSTRUCTION, IDEAL&mdash;A purely formal conception;
a theory, hypothesis; a logical determination not necessarily
based upon facts, but possessing virtue because of consistency;
a self-consistent scheme of thought.</p>

<p>COSMOS&mdash;Whenever the term "cosmos" appears in the
text spelled as here shown, it refers to phenomena pertaining to
the earth or the solar system; when spelled "kosmos" reference
is made to the universe as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>CRITERION OF TRUTH&mdash;Defined in the text as a
four-fold standard of reference, embracing the following elements,
namely, the causal, the sustentative, relational and developmental.
Lacking any one of these, no view of truth is
more than fragmentary. Applied to space, it contemplates an
inquiry into the genesis or causal aspect, an accounting for the
duration aspect, a recognition of its relation to the totality of
objects, and lastly, a prophecy of its telestic or perfective culmination.
This test has been applied to the study of space as
sketched in the text and the conclusions reached are an outcome
of the inquiry directed along these lines.</p>

<p>CURVATURE OF SPACE&mdash;A doctrine formulated by
<span class="smcap">Riemann</span> and which maintains that space is curved, and consequently,
all lines drawn therein are curved lines. Professor
<span class="smcap">Pickering</span> aptly describes the results of movements in
a curved space by pointing out that if we go far enough east
we arrive at the west; north, we arrive at the south; towards
the zenith, we arrive at the nadir, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>DEIFORM&mdash;The basic idea indicated is that the universe
is the form or body of the supreme deity, since He is not only
immanent in the kosmos, but sustains it by His life; that in
order to create a manifested universe, it was necessary to limit,
or sacrifice, in a measure, His own illimitability. Viewed in
this light, the kosmos assumes an added significance.</p>

<p>DIMENSION&mdash;(L. Dimensio, to measure), measurement;
a system of space measurement. The Euclidean geometry
recognizes three dimensions or coördinates as being necessary
to establish a point position; witness, the corners of a cube to
form which three of the edges come together at a point. These
edges represent coördinates. For the purposes of metageometry,
the term dimension has been variously defined, as, direction,
extent, a system of space measurement, or a system of coördinates.
Regarded as a series of coördinates, it became possible
to postulate a system which required four coördinates to estabish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the position of a point, as in the hypercube. There may
be five, six, seven, eight, or any number of such coördinate systems
according to the kind of space involved in the calculations.
Determinations based upon the logical necessities of the various
coördinate systems have been found to be self-consistent
throughout and, therefore, valid for metageometrical purposes.
Much depends upon the definition; for, after the definition has
been once determined it remains then merely to make inferences
and conclusions conform to the intent of the definition.</p>

<p>DIVERSITY&mdash;Philosophically, the idea indicated has reference
to all dissimilarities, differences, inequalities, divergent
tendencies, movements and characteristics to be noted in the
universum of life; the antithesis of kosmic unity; the natural
outcome of life in seeking expression; the result of the fragmentative
tendency of life.</p>

<p>DUODIM (duo, two; dim, abbreviation of dimension)&mdash;A
hypothetical being supposed to be possessed with a
consciousness adapted only to two dimensions; a dweller in
"Flatland" or two-space whose scope of motility is limited to
two directions, as on the face of a plane; a term invented by
hyperspace advocates for the purpose of establishing by analogy
some of the characteristics of the four space and also its
rationality.</p>

<p>DUOPYKNON (duo, two&mdash;pyknon, primary unit in the
process of kosmic involution, a condensation)&mdash;Secondary
phase in the elaboration of chaos into kosmic order. DUOPYKNOSIS
(duo, two, secondary&mdash;pyknosis, process of condensation
and origination)&mdash;The second period of the involutionary
movement of life during which the duadic plane of the kosmos
is being established; the second, in the series of seven distinct
phases, of space-genesis; dual differentiation of kosmic plasm.
Duopyknosis contemplates that, in the passage of the kosmos-to-be
from the plane of non-manifestation to the plane of manifestation,
there are seven distinct, though interdependent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
interrelational, stages through which life passes, and that, of
these, it is the second. It relates to the plane of non-manifestation
and is, therefore, beyond the ken of the intellectuality,
being a symbol.</p>

<p>EGOPSYCHE (Ego, the self-conscious I&mdash;psyche, soul)&mdash;The
mental, emotional and physical mechanisms of man, the
Thinker. These include the purely mental system, the emotional
or affective mechanism, the nerve-systems (cerebro-spinal
and sympathetic) and the brain; the objective or sense-derived
consciousness of the Thinker which is elaborated from the
total mass of perceptions transmitted through the senses; the
medium of self-consciousness; the intellectual consciousness as
distinguished from the intuitional or omnipsychic consciousness
(q.v.).</p>

<p>The notion of the egopsychic consciousness is based upon
data already empirically determined from the mass of evidences
everywhere observable. It seems to be apparent that
there is a consciousness, a seat of knowledge, in man the content
of which is unknown to the sense-consciousness. Dreams,
premonitions, intuitions, impressions and the totality of all such
phenomena substantiate this view. Furthermore, it is agreed
that the source of the intuition is not identical with that of
the intellect. The egopsychic consciousness, accordingly, is
purely intellectual.</p>

<p>FLUXION, PSYCHIC&mdash;The difference between a mental
image and an object; an image is the representation of certain
salient or cardinal characteristics of an object, sufficient
for identification; but an image is not congruent, in every respect,
with the object. Thus when we perceive an object,
although as <span class="smcap">Bergson</span> contends we perceive it in the place where
it is and not in the brain, it is the image of the object which
takes its place in memory and not the object itself. There is,
of course, a marked disparity between this memory-image and
the object. Even if the image possessed one of the properties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of the object, as, size, it could not take its place in memory,
and neither could it do so if it possessed any of the properties
of the real object. Consciousness is such that all due allowances
are made for these conditions and the mind is able to
retain more or less exact knowledge of these properties in the
image; but there is a difference, small though it may be. This
difference is the psychic fluxional.</p>

<p>FOHAT (Skt)&mdash;A term applied to the Creative Logos
who is said to be the generating element in the differentiation
of chaos into kosmic orderliness; the supreme deity in the rôle
of Creator.</p>

<p>FORM, PURE&mdash;An abstraction arrived at by subtracting
the last vestige of materiality or substantiality from an
idea and viewing the remains as a pure unsubstantial form or
idealization; the shell or frame-work of a material object or
condition; existing in idea or thought only; a mental conception
regarded as a type or norm; a purely hypothetical construction.</p>

<p>FOUR SPACE&mdash;Often referred to as the fourth dimension
(vide Chapter V); a space in which four coördinates (four
lines drawn perpendicular to each other) are necessary and
sufficient to establish the position of a point, as, a hypercube.</p>

<p>GAUSS, CHARLES FREDERICK, born at Brunswick,
April 30, 1777. His father, being a bricklayer, had intended
that he should follow the same occupation. So, in 1784,
Charles was sent to the Bütner Public School in Brunswick, in
order that he might be taught the ordinary elements of education.
But during his attendance at this school, his unusual intelligence
and aptitude attracted the attention and friendship
of Professor <span class="smcap">Bartels</span> who later became the Professor of Mathematics
at Dorpat. In 1792, through the kindly representations
of Professor <span class="smcap">Bartels</span> to the Duke of Brunswick, young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Gauss was sent to the Collegium Carolinum. This greatly displeased
his father as he saw in this move the frustration of his
plans for Charles. In 1794, however, <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> entered the University
of Göttingen still undecided whether he should make
mathematics or philology his life work. While residing at
Göttingen, he made his celebrated discoveries in analysis and
these turned his attention definitely to the field of mathematics.</p>

<p>He completed his studies at Göttingen and returned to
Brunswick in 1798, residing at Helmstadt where he had access
to the Library in the preparation of his <i>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</i>
which was published in 1801. He received his doctorate
degree (Ph.D.) on July 16, 1799. His next notable
work was the invention of a method by which he calculated
the elements of the orbit of the planet <i>Ceres</i> which had been
discovered by <span class="smcap">Piazzi</span>, January 1, 1800, and who had left no
record of his calculations by which other astronomers could
locate the planet. <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> also calculated an ephemeris of
<i>Ceres'</i> motion by means of which <span class="smcap">De Zach</span> rediscovered the
planet December 31, 1800.</p>

<p>His <i>Theoria Motus Corporum Coelestium in Conicis Sectionibus
Solem Ambientium</i>, in which the author gives a "complete
system of formulæ and processes for computing the movements
of a heavenly body revolving in a conic section" is an
outgrowth of his early researches and brought him lasting fame.</p>

<p>Through the influence of his friend <span class="smcap">Olbers</span>, he was appointed,
July 9, 1807, first director of the new Göttingen
Observatory, and Professor of Astronomy in the University, a
position which he held until the end of his life. He died
February 23, 1855. (Vide <i>Astronomical Society Notices</i>, Vol.
16, p. 80, 1856; also <i>Nature</i>, Vol. XV, pp. 533-537, 1877.)</p>

<p>GEOMETRISM&mdash;Of geometrical quality; a notion derived
from <span class="smcap">Plato's</span> declaration: "God geometrizes." It was
his belief that the creative acts of the deity are executed in
accordance with geometric design and laws; that in the totality
of such acts there necessarily inheres a latent geometric quality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Kant</span> closely adhered to this notion in his discussions of space
as an aspect of divine intelligence. He believed that the intellect
merely rediscovers this latent geometrism when it turns
to the study of materiality, and this belief is shared by <span class="smcap">Bergson</span>,
the foremost metaphysician of the present time.</p>

<p>HYPERSPACE (hyper, above, beyond, transcending&mdash;space)&mdash;That
species of space constructed by the intellect for
convenience of measurement; an idealized construction; a purely
arbitrary, conventional mathematical determination; the fourth
dimension; any space that requires more than three coördinates
to fix a point position in it, as, a five space, an <i>n</i>-space.</p>

<p>INTUITOGRAPH&mdash;The means by which the omnipsychic
consciousness transmits intuitional impressions to the
egopsychic or intellectual consciousness. An intuitogram is a
direct cognition, an intuition; a primary truth projected into
the egopsychic consciousness by the Thinker. It is recognized
that, under the necessities of the present schematism of things,
it is exceedingly difficult to propagate an intuition, especially
with the same degree of ease as concepts are propagable; yet,
this is believed to be a condition which will be overcome as the
evolution of the higher faculties proceeds.</p>

<p>INVOLUTION&mdash;Process of enfolding, involving; antithesis
of evolution; philosophically, the doctrine of involution
maintains that, during the process of kosmic pyknosis (space-genesis),
<i>all</i> that is to be expressed, developed and perfected
as a result of the evolutionary movement was first involved,
enfolded or deposited as latent archetypal tendencies and radicles
in the original world-plasm; that, as the involutionary
movement proceeded through the various phases of space-genesis,
these became more and more phenomenal until at last
they terminated in the elaboration of a manifest universe: each
stage, accordingly, of the involutionary procedure became the
basic substructure of a plane of specialized substance or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
materiality and consciousness. Thus it appears that evolution
really begins where involution ends (vide Fig. 18), and the
two opposing processes constitute the dualism of life as generating
element. This notion has been symbolized in the
<i>Lingam yoni</i> of Hellenistic philosophies, also in <i>Yang</i> and <i>Yin</i>
of Chinese philosophy, which represent the original pair of
opposites.</p>

<p>KATHEKOS&mdash;A purely arbitrary term devised for the
express purpose of providing a convenient symbol to convey the
idea embodied in the triglyph, <i>Chaos-Theos-Kosmos</i>, and is
composed of the first three letters in each one of the terms of
the triglyph; hence, symbolizes the triunity and interaction involved
in the resolution of chaos into an orderly kosmos by
the will of the Creative Logos. Thus, "kathekos" embodies a
quadruplicate notion, namely, chaos, Creative Logos, manifested
kosmos, and the creational activity of the Logos in the transmutation
of disorder into order. The justification for this term,
therefore, resides in its convenience, brevity and comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>By referring to figure 17, it will be seen that Kathekos
divides into two kinds&mdash;involutionary, or that which pertains to
involution, and evolutionary, or that that pertains to evolution.
It thus comprises the beginning and the end of the world age
or cycle and pertains to non-manifestation. The <i>raison d'être</i>
of this differentiation is embodied in the notion that, on the involutionary
arc of the cycle, the chaogenic period represents a
phase of the world age when space-genesis is in an archetypal
state wherein are involved all possibilities that are to become
manifest in the kosmos, and on the evolutionary arc, the kathekotic
period which is parallel to the chaogenic and represents a
phase of the world age when the kosmos has reached ultimate
perfection, embodying the perfected results of the possibilities
which inhered in the chaogenic period or in involutionary
kathekos. Thus, kathekos is dual in nature, on the one hand
representing kosmic potency, and on the other, kosmic perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of these potencies. It is Alpha, as related to involution,
and Omega, as related to evolution.</p>

<p>KATHEKOSITY&mdash;A derivative, signifying creative activity
and all that it implies; the state of consciousness or cognition
corresponding thereto.</p>

<p>KLEIN, FELIX (1849&mdash;), born at Dusseldorf; studied
at Bonn, and when only seventeen years of age was made assistant
to the noted <span class="smcap">Plücker</span> in the Physical Institute. He
took his doctorate degree in 1868, then went to Berlin, and
later to Göttingen where he assisted in editing <span class="smcap">Plücker's</span>
works. He entered the Göttingen faculty in 1871; became Professor
of Mathematics at Erlangen in 1872; and subsequently
held professorships at Munich, 1875; Leipzig, 1880, and Göttingen,
1886. No one else in Germany has exerted so great
influence upon American mathematics as he.</p>

<p>KOSMOS&mdash;<i>See Cosmos</i>.</p>

<p>LA GRANGE, JOSEPH LOUIS, born at Turin, January
25, 1736; died at Paris, April 10, 1813; regarded as the greatest
mathematician since the time of Newton. It may be interesting
to note that <span class="smcap">La Grange</span> remarked that mechanics is
really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry
of four dimensions, namely, time, and the three coördinates of
the point in space. (Vide <i>Ball's Account of the History of
Mathematics</i>.)</p>

<p>LIE, SOPHUS, a noted mathematician, referred to as
the "great comparative anatomist of geometric theories, creator
of the doctrines of Contact Transformations and Infinite Continuous
Groups, and revolutionizer of the Theory of Differential
Equations."</p>

<p>LOGOS&mdash;The supreme deity of the phenomenal universe;
Creator; Fohat; a planetary god; the deity of a solar system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>MANVANTARA (Skt.)&mdash;A world age; the periods of
involution and evolution combined; the stage during which
the universe is in manifestation; a Day of Brahma.</p>

<p>MATHESIS (Gr. mathein, to learn)&mdash;Erudition; profound
learning; the realm of metaphysical conceptions; the
field of higher mathematics; the sphere of conceivability; the
theoretical.</p>

<p>MENTOGRAPH&mdash;A cognitive factor consisting of a
complete perception fused or in coalescence with a memory-image.
Pure memory, of itself, is without utility as an aid to
cognition; but, when nourished or supplemented by the substance
of perception it becomes the basis of intellectual consciousness.</p>

<p>METAGEOMETRY (Gr. Meta, beyond, transcending&mdash;geometry)&mdash;Commonly,
any kind of geometry that differs
from the Euclidean, as the non-Euclidean; a geometry based
upon the assumption that the angular sum of a triangle is
greater or less than two right angles; the highest form of
geometry; a system of idealized mathematical constructions.
Sometimes called "pangeometry"; designated by <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> as
"Astral Geometry"; the geometry of hyperspace. It consists
of results arrived at by geometers in seeking a proof of the
parallel-postulate.</p>

<p>META-SELF&mdash;The higher self in man; the universal self;
the one self of which all individual selves are but fragments or
parts. In man, it is coördinate with the omnipsyche (q.v.)
and as such is the medium of kosmic consciousness.</p>

<p>MORPHOGENY (Gr. Morphe, form, vehicle, body&mdash;geny,
evolution)&mdash;The evolution of forms, the production of
individual bodies or vehicles for life, including organs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
faculties. Morphogenic&mdash;a derivative; pertaining to morphogeny;
a kosmic process (vide figs. 17 and 18).</p>

<p><i>N</i>-DIMENSIONALITY&mdash;Quality of conceptual space by
virtue of which it may be regarded as possessing an indefinite
number of dimensions.</p>

<p>NEAR-TRUTH&mdash;Any statement or view which is based
upon partial knowledge; predicates concerning a class or genus
derived from limited acquaintance with particulars of the class
or genus; statements based upon logical determinations inhering
in idealized constructions and applied to concrete or objective
conditions; an abstraction viewed as a reality; the application
of the qualities of abstractions to realities.</p>

<p>NEUROGRAM&mdash;Psychologically, a movement received by
the afferent nerves in the form of a stimulation and transmitted
through the brain and efferent nerves as either a reflex or voluntary
action; a nerve impulse; a perception; a primary unit
of intellectual consciousness; cf. <i>Intuitogram</i>.</p>

<p>NEWCOMB, SIMON (1835-1909), born at Wallace,
Nova Scotia; educated in his father's school and came to the
United States in 1853. Began, in 1854, teaching in Maryland;
was appointed computer on <i>Nautical Almanac</i> at Cambridge
in 1857; was graduated at Lawrence Scientific School
in 1858; appointed Professor of Mathematics in the U. S. Navy
in 1861. He supervised the construction of the 26-inch
equatorial telescope at the Naval Observatory, and was secretary
of the Transit of Venus Commission; was a member of
nearly all of the Imperial and Royal societies of Europe and
of the various societies in the United States, receiving the
Copley Medal in 1874; the Huygens, 1878; the Royal Society,
1890, and the Bruce Medal in 1898; held the presidency of
the following learned societies, viz: American Association for
the Advancement of Science, 1877; Society for Psychical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Research, 1885-1886; American Mathematical Society, 1897-1898;
the Astronomical and Astrophysical Society of America
from its foundation in 1899. He rendered notable service in
popularizing the doctrine of hyperspace.</p>

<p>NORM&mdash;An authoritative standard; model or type; standard
of reference. The choice of a norm for spatial determinations
cannot abide in any premise except that which naturally,
and not artificially and conventionally, conforms to what is
actually perceived; if so, there should be justification for challenging
the wisdom and utility of the present schematism of
things. There is an inherent conformity of space with intellect
and intellect with space, and because of this natural complementarity
of part with part and whole with whole, space cannot
be otherwise than the intellectuality normally conceives it to
be, provided, of course, that the cognitive movement is free
and untrammeled by arbitrary hindrances. Consciousness,
therefore, is the norm or standard of reference for all questions
arising out of a consideration of spatiality.</p>

<p>OMNIPSYCHE&mdash;A term used to denote the Thinker's
cognitive apparatus; the universal soul manifesting in individuals;
the consciousness of the Thinker in virtue of which
he is at-one with the universal consciousness; the medium of
kosmic consciousness; the source of the intuition, cf. <i>Egopsyche</i>.
The divinity in man (which is taken for granted), or his
highest self can in no way be said justly to take its rise from
sense-experience or from any bodily process. If divine, then
eternal, and therefore, persistent. Broadly, the doctrine of
evolution recognizes the passage of life from form to form,
adding a little to each successive form and inevitably pushing
each to a higher degree of perfection. Now, what is it that
passes from form to form? Is it undifferentiated life or is it a
specialized form of life? From every evidence, it would be
judged that the life that ensouls an individual form is a specialized
principle, i.e., limited to the execution of a given purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
If life as a specialized principle, limited to the execution of a
given purpose in each form, passes on, it must preserve, at least,
the sublimated results obtained during its residence in each individual
form. It would thus become a sort of reservoir containing
all these transmuted results. The omnipsyche, within
the meaning of the text, is precisely this specialized life principle.</p>

<p>PARALLEL-POSTULATE&mdash;Variously referred to as the
XIth, XIIth and XIIIth axiom of the <i>Elements of Euclid</i>;
stated by <span class="smcap">Manning</span>, in <i>Non-Euclidean Geometry</i>, p. 91, in the
following form: "If two lines are cut by a third, and the sum
of the interior angles on the same side of the cutting line is
less than two right angles, the lines will meet on that side
when sufficiently produced." This celebrated postulate has
proven to be the most fruitful ever devised; for it embodies
in itself the possibility of three geometries based respectively
upon the following assumptions, namely: I. That there exists
a triangle, the sum of whose angles is congruent to a straight
angle, the Euclidean; II. That there exists a triangle the sum
of whose angles is less than a straight angle, the <span class="smcap">Lobachevskian</span>;
III. That there exists a triangle the sum of whose angles
is greater than a straight angle, the <span class="smcap">Cayley-Klein</span>. Speaking
of the content of the last two named, <span class="smcap">Edward Moffat
Weyer</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> says: "Hypothetical realms, wherein the dimensions
of space are assumed to be greater in number than three, yield
strange geometries, which are only card castles, products of a
sort of intellectual play in the construction of which the laws
of logic supply the rules of the game. The character of each is
determined by whatsoever assumption its builder lays down
at the start."</p>

<p>PASSAGE OF SPACE&mdash;A phrase connoting the movement
of space from chaos to perfect order, a process believed
to be infinite. The genesis of space necessarily implies an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
elaboration, a procedure, by which the metamorphosis from disorder
to kosmic order is made, and this movement is referred
to as the "passage of space," a phenomenon thought to be
measurable by means of a suitable instrumentality.</p>

<p>PERISOPHISM&mdash;See <i>Near-Truth</i>.</p>

<p>PSEUDOSPHERE&mdash;A surface of constant negative curvature;
basis of <span class="smcap">Beltrami's</span> metageometrical calculations; surface
resembling a champagne glass or common spool. The
assumption that space is pseudospherical has given rise to the
notion of space-curvature and various other conceptions.</p>

<p>PSYCHOGENY (Gr. Psyche, Soul&mdash;geny)&mdash;History of
the evolution of the soul or the development of the senso-mechanism
in organisms. <span class="smcap">Ernst Haeckel</span> has traced the
psychogeny of man through twenty-two different stages from
the moneron to the anthropoid apes, and man.</p>

<p>PRALAYA (Skt.)&mdash;Kosmic quietude; the period during
which the universe is not in manifestation; gestatory period;
kosmic inactivity; opposed to manvantara (q.v.); figuratively,
the kosmic womb; world egg.</p>

<p>PYKNON (Gr. pyknon, hard)&mdash;The principle of kosmic
condensation; the primary basis of space-genesis; the initiation
of the process by virtue of which chaos is elaborated into kosmic
order. PYKNOSIS&mdash;The process of spatial engenderment.
There are seven of these processes, each indicating a phase of
duration, namely: MONOPYKNOSIS, the primary phase;
DUOPYKNOSIS, secondary; TRIPYKNOSIS, tertiary.
These three pertain to the plane of non-manifestation, the pralayic
or gestatory duration-phase. The results arrived at during
these duration-phases are concentrated in the Quartopyknotic
which corresponds to the causal plane of manifestation or pure
kosmic spirituality. QUINTOPYKNOSIS, a process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
concerned in the genesis of mentality; SEXTOPYKNOSIS, kosmic
sensibility; SEPTOPYKNOSIS, kosmic materiality. These
seven phases of duration constitute the scope of space genesis or
kosmogenesis, and incidentally depose the substructure of kosmic
materiality, sensibility, intellectuality and spirituality, as
well as the higher trinity of kosmic modes. The ramifications
of these principles are innumerable and omnipresent. (See
Chapter VII.)</p>

<p>QUARTODIM&mdash;A hypothetical being assumed to have a
consciousness adapted to hyperspace or the fourth dimension,
and whose scope of action is encompassed within a space which
requires four coördinates, as the four-space.</p>

<p>REALITY (Realism)&mdash;Life; the harmony existing among
the parts to maintain their equilibrium in the whole; the principle
of integrity subsisting among parts; kosmic vitality.</p>

<p>RIEMANN, GEORGE FREDERICH BERNHARD,
was born September 17, 1826, in the village of Breselenz, near
Dannenburg, in Hanover. Until he was eight years of age
his father was his sole tutor, but even at this age he exhibited
great powers of arithmetical calculation. In the Spring of 1840
young <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> was sent to the Hanover Lyceum where he
remained for two years, leaving in 1842 for the Gymnasium at
Luneburg. Here, under the direction of Professor <span class="smcap">Schmalfuss</span>,
he learned very rapidly, and is said to have required only
one week thoroughly to familiarize himself with <span class="smcap">Legendre's</span>
<i>Theory of Numbers</i>.</p>

<p>On April 12, 1846 (Easter), he entered the University of
Göttingen as a student of Theology in accordance with his
father's wishes. His passion for mathematics, however, was
so aroused by the lectures of <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> that He begged his father
to be allowed to devote himself entirely to the studies of his
choice. For two years he studied under <span class="smcap">Jacobi</span> at Berlin. He
then returned to Göttingen, and was graduated, his thesis being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a dissertation on the foundations of a general theory of functions
of a variable complex magnitude. In 1854 he qualified
as a teacher by giving a lecture on the "Hypothesis on which
Geometry is Founded." In 1857 he became "Professor Extraordinarius,"
and in 1859 was elected Corresponding Member
of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin and in 1860 a member of
the Academy of Sciences of Göttingen.</p>

<p>After four years of failing health, during which he visited
Messina, Palermo, Naples, Rome, Florence, Pisa and Milan,
he died at Lago Maggiore, July 20, 1866, in full possession of
his faculties and conscious of his approaching end.</p>

<p>SCHWEIKART, FERDINAND KARL (1780-1857),
studied from 1796 to 1798 in Marburg, attending the mathematical
lectures of <span class="smcap">J. K. F. Hauff</span>. In 1812 he became professor
in Charkov, a position which he held for four years. In
1816 he became a tutor in the City of Marburg where he remained
until 1820 when he transferred his labors to Königsberg.
It was during his tutorship at Charkov, Marburg and Königsberg
that he, entirely alone and without the slightest suggestion
from any man, developed and taught a non-Euclidean geometry
to the students under his care. For copy of his treatise on
non-Euclidean geometry, see <i>Historical Sketch of the Hyperspace
Movement</i>, Chapter II.</p>

<p>SCOPOGRAPHIC IMPRESSIONS&mdash;Sight perceptions
fused with an associated memory-image, and forming the basis
of action on external phenomena.</p>

<p>SENSOGRAPHIC IMPRESSIONS&mdash;Perceptions or impulses
transmitted through the nerves of a sense-organ; any
impression acting through the media of the senses.</p>

<p>SENSIBLE WORLD&mdash;The world of the senses; that
which responds to the senses; the domain of perception; the
phenomenal world; world of perceptual space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>SPACE-CURVATURE (see <i>Curvature of Space</i>).</p>

<p>SPACE-GENESIS&mdash;The process of spatial engenderment;
the movement of life as engendering agent in bringing into
manifestation the kosmos; the story of the appearance of the
organized kosmos. The genesis of space can only be symbolized,
as has been done in the text, for the limitations of human consciousness
do not otherwise admit of the empirical establishment
of the notion of its detailed procedure.</p>

<p>SPATIALITY&mdash;Space as a dynamic, creative movement;
kosmic order, as opposed to disorder; the path of the engendering
movement of life; the place of life. Spatiality, materiality,
intellectuality and geometricity or the latent geometrism of the
kosmos are thought of as being consubstantial and interdependent;
but, of these, spatiality is regarded as the substance
out of which the latter three are elaborated.</p>

<p>SUPERCONCEPTUAL&mdash;The purely intuitional; an act
of cognition performed without the detailed work of conception
derived from sense-data; conception of intuitions and their
inter-relations; the Thinker's consciousness freed from intellectual
characterization.</p>

<p>SUPERPERCEPTION&mdash;Perception of conceptual relations;
a state of cognition wherein, instead of receiving percepts
or images from the external world, then elaborating them into
concepts, the Thinker apprehends composite images or concepts
at first hand. It is a power which the liberated mind of
the future will possess owing to the growing automatism of
the intellect and the more facile expression of the intuitional
consciousness.</p>

<p>TESSERACT (Gr. Tessera, four, cube, tessella)&mdash;A
hypercube (see Chapter V.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>THINKER (Skt. Manu, thinker)&mdash;The real, spiritual
man, as differentiated from his perceptive vehicles&mdash;mind, emotions
and physical body; the omnipsychic intelligence who receives,
classifies, interprets and preserves percepts; the manipulator
of concepts; in fine, the higher, spiritual man.</p>

<p>The Thinker uses the various perceptive instrumentalities
as so many tentacles or antennae by which he contacts the sensible
world and makes the necessary adaptations to environment.
He is the pure intelligence which is the source of all
cognitive motivation; opposed to ego, because the egopsychic
instrumentality is essentially an individualizing, separative
agency; while the Thinker's omnipsychic intelligence is the
basis of his unity with the universal intelligence. This conception
of the Thinker implies that, as a spiritual intelligence, he
is within and without the body, filling it as the ocean fills the
sponge, encompassing, enveloping it and, at the same time,
originating the totality of activities which manifest in and
through the body. He is limited, therefore, in his manifestations
in the sensible world only by the pliability of his vehicles.</p>

<p>TRANSFINITY&mdash;A state or condition that is incomprehensible
to finite intelligence; that which transcends the finite,
yet is not infinite; less than infinity and greater than finity.
Space is referred to as being transfinite rather than infinite in
extent. But space transfinite should be distinguished from
space "finite though unbounded." For, there would seem to
be little worthy of choice between a "finite, unbounded space"
and an infinite one. The absence of boundary would naturally
suggest an infinite extent. And although <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> who is
the author of the "unbounded" space arbitrarily determined
that such a space should be a manifold possessing a measure of
curvature which could be determined either by counting or
actual measurement, he undoubtedly knew, nevertheless, that
while each manifold might be an "unbounded" space the totality
of such manifolds, infinite in number, must also be infinite in
extent. It would seem to do violence to common sense, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to logical necessity, to view space both as "unbounded" and
finite in extent, yet there would be no such difficulty in the
recognition of space as being both transfinite and finite; because
it is conceivable that the extent and character of space
finite should transcend a finite intellectuality, and yet not be
infinite.</p>

<p>TRIDIM&mdash;A being whose scope of consciousness is
limited to a space of three dimensions, as ordinary human beings.
TRIDIMENSIONALITY&mdash;That quality possessed by perceptual
space by virtue of which it is necessary and sufficient to
have three coördinates, and only three, to establish the position
of a point.</p>

<p>UNODIM&mdash;A hypothetical being assumed to have a consciousness
limited to linear or one-space.</p>

<p>ZONES OF AFFINITY&mdash;Regions in the domain of intellectuality
wherein minds, possessing a common differential,
rate of vibration or quality, adhere to certain tenets from
choice. Schools of philosophy, religions, and all those major
divisions of intellectual effort which divide and subdivide intellectual
allegiance are believed to take their rise in this property
of intellectuality in virtue of which all minds having a
similar coefficient gravitate towards a common agreement, especially
where the movement is voluntary and untrammeled.</p>

<p>In presenting this volume to the public profound
apologies are made to the professional mathematician
for the temerity which is shown thereby. All technical
discussion of the problems pertinent to the
geometry of hyperspace, however, has been carefully
avoided. The reader is, therefore, referred to the
bibliography published at the end of this volume for
matter relating to this aspect of the subject. The
aim rather has been to outline briefly the progress of
mathematical thought which has led up to the idea
of the multiple dimensionality of space; to state the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
cardinal principles of the Non-Euclidean geometry
and to offer an interpretation of the metageometrical
concept in the light of the evolutionary nature of
human faculties and material characteristics and
properties.</p>

<p>The onus of this treatise is, therefore, to distinguish
between what is commonly known as sensible
space and that other species of space known as geometric
spaces. Also to show that the notion which
has been styled <i>hyperspace</i> is nothing more nor less
than an evidence of the faint, early outcroppings in
the human mind of a faculty which, in the course of
time, will become the normal possession of the entire
human race. Thus the weight of all presentations will
be to give currency to the belief, very strongly held,
that humanity, now in its infancy, is yet to evolve
faculties and capabilities, both mental and spiritual,
to a degree hitherto viewed as inconceivable.</p>

<p>On this view it must appear that the faculty of
thought including the powers of imagination and conceptualization
are not psychological invariants, but, on
the other hand, are true variants. They are, consequently,
answerable to the principle of evolution just
as all vital phenomena are. Some have thought that
no matter what idea may come into the mind of the
human race or at what time the idea may be born
the mind always has been able to conceive it. That
is, many believe that the nature of mind is such that
no matter how complex an idea may be there has
always been in the mind the power of conceiving it.
But this view cannot be said to have the support of
any trustworthy testimony. If so, then the mind must
at once be recognized as fully matured and capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
during every epoch of human evolution, no less in the
first than in the latest, which, of course, is absurd. It
is undoubtedly more reasonable and correct to believe
that the powers of conceptualization are matters of
evolutionary concern. For instance, the assertion that
the mind was incapable of conceiving, in the realm
of theology, a non-anthropomorphic god, or, in the
field of biology, the doctrine of evolution, or, in the
domain of invention, the wireless telegraph, or, in
mathematics, the concept of hyperspace before the
actual time of these conceptions, cannot be successfully
controverted.</p>

<p>In fact, it may be laid down as one of the first
principles of psychogenesis that the mind rarely, if
ever, conceives an idea until it has previously developed
the power of conceptualizing it and giving it
expression in the terms of prior experience. As in
the growth of the body there are certain processes
which require the full development of the organ of
expression before they can be safely executed so in
the phyletic development of faculties there are certain
ideas, conceptions and scopes of mental vision which
cannot be visualized or conceptualized until the basis
for such mentation has been laid by the appearance of
previously developed faculties of expression. And
especially is this true of the intellect. Inasmuch as
the entire content of the intellect is constituted of
sense-derived knowledge, with the exception of intuitions
which are not of intellectual origin though dependent
upon the intellect for interpretation, there can
be no doubt as to the necessity of there being first
deposed in the intellect a sense-derived basis for intellection
before it can become manifest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Sensationalists, led by <span class="smcap">Leibnitz</span>, propounded as their
fundamental premise this dictum: "<i>There is nothing
in the intellect which has not first been in the senses
except the intellect itself</i>," and this has never been
gainsaid by any school that could disprove it. The
intuitionalist does not deny it: he merely claims that
we are the recipients of another form of knowledge,
the intuitional, which, instead of being derived from
sense-experience, is projected into the intellectual consciousness
from another source which we designate
the Thinker. Thus, from the two forms of consciousness,
come into the area of awareness truths
that spring from entirely different sources. From the
one source a steady stream of impressions flow constituting
the substance of intellectual consciousness;
from the other only a drop, every now and then, falls
into the great inrushing mass so as to add a dim
phosphorescence to an otherwise unilluminated pool.
Obviously, when there is a lack of sensuous data from
which a certain concept may be elaborated there can
be no conception based upon them, and as the variety
and quality of concepts are in exact proportion to the
variety and quality of sense-experience there can be
no demand for a particular species of notions such
as might be elaborated out of the absent or non-existent
perception. Hence, the power of conceiving
springs forth from sense-experience. Sense-experience
is essentially a mass of perceptions: these, creating a
demand for additional adaptations, conspire, as if, to
evoke the power or faculty to meet the demand, and
consequently, an added conceptualization is made.</p>

<p>Progress in human thought is made in a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
similar to that which prevails in the development of
other natural processes, such as, the power of speech
in the child. In the development of this faculty there
are certain definite stages which appear in due sequence.
The child is not gifted with the power of speech at
once. It comes, by gradual and sometimes painful
growth, into a full use of this faculty. Now, much
the same principle holds true in the evolution of the
mind in the human species. It is an established
biologic principle that the ontogenetic processes manifested
in the individual are but a recapitulation of the
phylogenetic processes which are observable in the
progress of the entire species. The view becomes
even more cogent when note is taken of the fact that
the foetus, during embryogenesis, passes successively
through stages of growth which have been shown to
be analogous, if not identical, with those stages through
which the human species has developed, namely, the
mineral, vegetal and animal.</p>

<p>Wherefore it may be said that the fourth dimensional
concept marks a distinct stage in psychogenesis
or evolution of mind. It required, as will be shown
in Chapter II, nearly two thousand years for it to
germinate, take root and come to full fruition. For
it was not until the early years of the nineteenth century
that mathematicians, taking inspiration from
<span class="smcap">Riemann</span> (1826-1866) fully recognized the concept
as a metaphysical possibility, or even the idea was
conceived at all. Serious doubt is entertained as to
the possibility of its conception by any human mind
before this date, that is, the time when it was actually
born. Prior to that time, mathematical thought was
taking upon itself that shape and tendence which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
eventually lead to the discovery of hyperspace; but it
could not have reached the zenith of its upward strivings
at one bound. That would have been unnatural.</p>

<p>Such is the constitution of the mind that although
it is the quantity which bridges the chasm between the
two stages of man's evolution when he merely thinks
and when he really knows it is entirely under the
domain of law and must observe the times and seasons,
as it were, in the performance of its functions. The
scope of psychogenesis is very broad, perhaps unlimited;
but its various stages are very clearly defined
notwithstanding the breadth of its scope of motility.
And while the distance from <i>moneron</i> to man, or
from feeling to thinking is vast, the gulf which separates
man, the Thinker, from man, the knower, is
vaster still. Who, therefore, can say what are the
delights yet in store for the mind as it approaches,
by slow paces, the goal whereat it will not need to
struggle through the devious paths of perceiving, conceiving,
analyzing, comparing, generalizing, inferring
and judging; but will be able to know definitely, absolutely
and instantaneously? That some such consummation
as this shall crown the labors of mental evolution
seems only natural and logical.</p>

<p>It may be thought by some that the character and
content of revelational impressions constitute a variation
from the requirements of the law above referred
to, but a little thought will expose the fallacy of this
view. The nature of a revealed message is such as
to make it thoroughly amenable to the restrictions
imposed by the evolutionary aspects of mind in general.
That this is true becomes apparent upon an examination
of the four cardinal characteristics of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
impressions. First, we have to consider the indefinite
character of an apocalyptic ideograph which is due
to its symbolic nature. This is a feature which relieves
the impression of any pragmatic value whatsoever,
especially for the period embracing its promulgation.
Then, such cryptic messages may or may not be understood
by the recipient in which latter case it is
nonpropagable. Second, the necessity of previous
experience in the mind of the recipient in order that
he may be able to interpret to his own mind the psychic
impingement. The basis which such experience affords
must necessarily be present in order that there may
be an adequate medium of mental qualities and powers
in which the ideogram may be preserved. A third
characteristic is that revelations quite invariably presuppose
a contemplative attitude of mind which, in
the very nature of the case, superinduces a state of
preparedness in the mind for the proper entertainment
of the concept involved. This fact proves quite conclusively
that revelational impressions are not exceptions
to the general rule. Lastly, a dissatisfaction
with the conditions with which the symbolism deals
or to which it pertains is also a prerequisite. This
condition is really that which calls forth the cryptic
annunciation, and yet, preceding it is a long series of
causes which have produced both the conditions and
the revolt which the revelator feels at their presence.
In view of the foregoing, it would appear that objections
based upon the alleged nonconformity of the
revealed or inspired cannot be entertained as it must
be manifest that it, too, falls within the scope of the
laws of mental growth.</p>

<p>Discoveries, whether of philosophical or mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
nature, or whether of ethical or purely mathematical
tendence, are never the results of a deliberate,
methodical or purposive reflection. For instance, let
us take <span class="smcap">Lie's</span> "transformation groups," mathematic
contrivances used in the solution of certain theorems.
Now, it ought to be obvious that these mathetic
machinations were not discovered by <span class="smcap">Sophus Lie</span> as
a consequence of any methodic or purposeful intention
on his part. That is, he did not set out deliberately
to discover "transformation groups." For back
of the "groups" lay the entire range of analytic investigations;
the mathematical thought of more than
a thousand years furnished the substructure upon which
Lie built the conception of his "groups." Similarly,
it may be said with equal assurance that no matter
how great the intensity of thought, nor how purposeful,
nor of how long duration the series of concentrated
abstractions which led up to the invention of
the printing press, the linotype or multiplex printing
press of our day could not have been produced abruptly,
nor by use of the mental dynamics of the
human mind of remoter days. Its production had
to follow the path outlaid by the laws of psychogenesis
and await the development of those powers which
alone could give it birth. The whole question resolves
itself, therefore, into the idea of the complete
subserviency of the mind, in all matters of special
moment, to the laws aforementioned. The supersession
of the law of its own life by the mind is well-nigh
unthinkable, if not quite so.</p>

<p>If we now view the history of the mind as manifested
in the human species, three great epochs which
divide the scope of mental evolution into more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
less well-defined stages present themselves. These
are: first, the <i>formative stage</i>; second, <i>the determinative
stage</i>; third, the stage of <i>freedom</i>, or the
<i>elaborative</i> stage.</p>

<p>In all of the early races of men, through every
step which even preceded the <i>genus homo</i>, the generic
mind was being formulated. It was being given shape,
outline and direction. All of the first stage, the
<i>formative</i>, was devoted to organization and direction.
Those elementary sensations which constituted the
basis of mind in the primitive man were accordingly
strongly determinative of what the mind should be in
these latter days. To this general result were contributed
the effects of the activity of cells, nerves,
bones, fibers, muscles and the blood.</p>

<p>The <i>formative</i> period naturally covered a very
extensive area in the history of mind or psychogenetic
development. It was followed closely, but almost insensibly,
by the <i>determinative</i> period during which all
the latent powers, capacities and faculties which were
the direct products of the <i>formative</i> period were being
utilized in meeting the demands of the law of necessity.
The making of provisions against domestic
want, against the attacks of external foes; the combating
of diseases, physical inefficiency, the weather,
wild beasts, the asperities of tribal enmities; as well
as furthering the production of art, music, sculpture,
the various branches of handiwork, literature, philosophies,
religions and the effectuation of all those
things which now appear as the result of the mental
activity of the present-day man make up the essence
and purpose of the determinative period.</p>

<p>Signs of the dawn of the <i>elaborative</i> stage, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
called the stage of <i>freedom</i>, have been manifest now
for upwards of three centuries and it is, therefore,
in its beginnings. It is not fully upon us. Not yet
can we fully realize what it may mean, nor can we
unerringly forecast its ultimate outcome; but we feel
that it is even now here in all the glories of its
matutinal freshness. And the mind is beginning to be
free from the grinding necessities of the constructive
period having already freed itself from the restrictive
handicaps of the primeval formulation period. Already
the upgrowing rejuvenescences so common at
the beginning of a new period are commencing to
show themselves in every department of human activity
in the almost universal desire for greater freedom.
And this is particularly noticeable in the many
political upheavals which, from time to time, are
coming to the surface as well as in the countless other
aspects of the wide-spread renaissance. Perhaps the
time may come, never quite fully, when there will be
no longer any necessity to provide against the external
exigencies of life; perhaps, the time will never be
when the mind shall no more be bound by the law
of self-preservation, not even when it has attained
unto the immortality of absolute knowledge; yet, it is
intuitively felt that it must come to pass that the mind
shall be vastly freer than it is to-day. And with this
new freedom must come liberation from the necessities
of the elementary problems of mere physical existence.</p>

<p>The inference is, therefore, drawn that the fourth
dimensional concept, and all that it connotes of hyperspace
or spaces of <i>n</i>-dimensionality are some of the
evidences that this stage of freedom is dawning. And
the mind, joyous at the prospect of unbounded liberty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
which these concepts offer, cannot restrain itself but
has already begun to revel in the sunlit glories of
a newer day. What the end shall be; what effect
this new liberty will have on man's spiritual and
economic life; and what it may mean in the upward
strivings of the Thinker for that sublime perpetuity
which is always the property of immediate knowledge
no one can hope, at the present time, to fathom. It
is, however, believed with <span class="smcap">Keyser</span> that "it is by the
creation of hyperspaces that the rational spirit
secures release from limitation"; for, as he says, "in
them it lives ever joyously, sustained by an unfailing
sense of infinite freedom."</p>

<p>The elevating influence of abstract thinking, such
as excogitation upon problems dealing with entities
inhabiting the domain of <i>mathesis</i> is, without doubt,
incalculable in view of the fact that it is only through
this kind of thought that the spirit is enabled to reach
its highest possibilities. This is undoubtedly the
philosophy of those religious and occult exercises
known as "meditations," and this perhaps was the
main idea in the mind of the Hebrew poet when he
exclaimed: "Let the words of my mouth and the
meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O
Lord, my strength and my Redeemer." The principal,
if not the only, value possessed by the "summitless
hierarchies of hyperspaces" which the mathematician
constructs in the world of pure thought is
the enrichening and ennobling influence which they
exert upon the mind. But admittedly this unbounded
domain of mathetic territory which he explores and
which he finds "peopled with ideas, ensembles, propositions,
relations and implications in endless variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and multiplicity" is quite real to him and subsists
under a reign of law the penalties of which, while not
as austere and unreasonable as some which we find in
our tridimensional world, are nevertheless quite as
palpable and as much to be feared. For the orthodoxy
of mathematics is as cold and intolerant as ever the
religious fanatic can be. But the reality and even the
actuality which may be imputed to the domain of
mathesis is of an entirely different quality from that
which we experience in our world of triune dimensionality
and it is a regrettable error of judgment to
identify them. It ought, therefore, never be expected,
nor is it logically reasonable to assume that the entities
which inhabit the mathetic realm of the analyst
should be submissive to the laws of sensible space;
nor that the conditions which may be found therein
can ever be made conformable to the conditions which
exist in perceptual space.</p>

<p>It was <span class="smcap">Plato's</span> belief that ideas alone possessed
reality and what we regard as actual and real is on
account of its ephemerality and evanescence not real
but illusionary. This view has been shared by a number
of eminent thinkers who followed, with some ostentation,
the lead established by <span class="smcap">Plato</span>. For a considerable
period of time this school of thinkers had
many adherents; but the principles at length fell into
disrepute owing to the absurdities indulged in by some
of the less careful followers. The realism, or for
that matter, the actuality of ideas cannot be denied;
yet it is a realism which is neither to be compared
with the physical reality of sense-impressions nor its
phenomena. The character and peculiarity of ideas
are in a class apart from similar notions of perceptual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
space content. It is as if we were considering the
potentialities of the spirit world and the entities
therein in connection with incarnate entities which in
the very nature of the case is not allowable. Furthermore,
it is unreasonable to suppose that the conditions
on a higher plane than the physical can be made responsible
to a similar set of conditions on the physical
plane.</p>

<p>There are certain astronomers who base their
speculations as to the habitability of other planets
upon the absurd hypothesis that the conditions of life
upon all planets must be the same as those on the
earth, forgetting that the extent of the universe and
the scope of motility of life itself are of such a nature
as to admit of endless variations and adaptations.
There is a realism of ideas and a realism of perceptual
space. Yet this is no reason why the two
should be identified. On the other hand, owing to
the diversity in the universe, every consideration would
naturally lead to the assumption that they are dissimilar.
To invest ideas, notions, implications and
inferences with a reality need not logically or otherwise
affect the reality of a stone, a fig, or even of a
sense-impression.</p>

<p>To a being on the spirit levels our grossest realities
must appear as non-existent. They are neither
palpable nor contactable in any manner within the
ordinary range of physical possibilities. For us his
gravest experiences can have no reality whatsoever; for
no matter how real an experience may be to him it is
altogether beyond our powers of perception, and
therefore, to us non-existent also. It should, however,
be stated that the state of our knowledge about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
given condition can in no way affect its existence. It
merely establishes the fact that two or more realities
may exist independent of one another and further that
the gamut of realism in the universe is infinite and
approaches a final state when its occlusion into absolute
being follows as a logical sequence.</p>

<p>Recurring to the consideration of the reality of
spirit-realms as compared with that of sensible space,
it comes to view that our idealism, that is, the idealism
which is a quality of conceptualization, may be regarded
as identical with their realism, at least as
being on the same plane as it. Stated differently, the
things that are ideal to us and which constitute the
data of our consciousness may be as real to them as
the commonest object of sense-knowledge is to us.
What, therefore, appears to us as the most ethereal
and idealistic may have quite a realistic character for
them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, and in the final deeps of
analysis it will be found undoubtedly that both our
realism and our idealism as well as similar qualities
of the spirit world are in all essential considerations
quite illusionary. All knowledge gained in a condition
short of divinity itself is sadly relative. Even mathematical
knowledge falls far short of the absolute, the
fondest claims of the orthodox mathematician to the
contrary notwithstanding. It has been said frequently
that a mathematical fact is an absolute fact and that
its verity, necessity and certainty cannot be questioned
anywhere in the universe whether on Jupiter, Neptune,
Fomalhaut, Canopus or Spica. But having so
declared, the fact of the sheer relativity of our
knowledge is not disturbed thereby nor controverted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Happily, neither distance nor a lack of distance can
in any way affect the quality of human knowledge,
mathematical knowledge not excepted. That can only
be affected by conditions which cause it to approach
perfection and nothing but evolution can do that.</p>

<p>In the light of results obtained in analytic investigations
the question of the flexibility of mathematical
applications becomes evident and one instead of being
convinced of the vaunted invariability of the laws
obtaining in the world of mathesis is, on the other
hand, made aware of the remarkable and seemingly
unrestrained facility with which these laws may be
made to apply to any conditions or set of assumptions
within the range of the mind's powers of conception.
Mathematicians have deified the <i>definition</i> and endowed
it with omnific powers imputing unto it all the
attributes of divinity&mdash;immutability, invariance, and
sempiternity. In this they have erred grievously although,
perhaps, necessarily. Mathetic conclusions
are entirely conditional and depend for their certainty
upon the imputed certitude of other propositions which
in turn are dependent, in ever increasing and endlessly
complex relations, upon previously assumed
postulates. These facts make it exceedingly difficult
to understand the attitude of mind which has obscured
the utter mutability and consequent ultimate unreliability
of the fine-spun theories of analytic machinations.</p>

<p>The apriority of all mathematical knowledge is
open to serious questioning. And although there is
no hesitancy in admitting the basic agreement of the
most primary facts of mathematical knowledge with
the essential character of the intellect the existence
of well-defined limits for such congruence cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
gainsaid. The subjunctive quality of geometric and
analytical propositions is made apparent by an examination
of the possibilities falling within the scope
of permissibility offered by mathetic license. For instance,
privileged to proceed according to the analytic
method it is allowable to reconstruct the sequence of
values in our ordinary system of enumeration so as
to admit of the specification of a new value for say,
the entire series of odd numbers. This value might
be assumed to be a plus-or-minus one, dependent upon
its posture in the series. That is, all odd numbers
in the series beginning with the digit 3, and continuing,
5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ... <i>n</i>, could be assumed
to have only a place value which might be regarded
as a constant-variable. The series of even numbers,
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ... <i>n</i>, may be assumed
to retain their present sequence values. Under this
system the digit 1 would have an absolute value; all
other odd numbers would have a constant-variable
value; constant, because always no more nor less than
1 dependent upon their place in the operations and
whether their values were to be applied by addition
or subtraction to or from one of the values in the
even number series; variable, because their values
would be determinable by their application and algebraic
use.</p>

<p>There would, of course, be utilitarian objection to
a system of this kind; but under the conditions of a
suppositionary hypothesis, it would be self-consistent
throughout, and if given universal assent would suit
our purposes equally as well as our present system.
But the fact that this can be done under the mathematic
method verily proves the violability of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
mathematical laws and completely negatives the assumption
that the sum of any two digits, as say 2 plus 2 equals
4, is necessarily and unavoidably immutable. For
it can be seen that the sum-value of all numbers may
be made dependent upon the assumed value which may
be assigned to them or to any collection thereof.
Furthermore, it is a matter of historical knowledge
that it was the custom of ancient races of men to
account for values by an entirely different method from
what we use to-day. The latter is a result of evolution
and while experience teaches that it is by far the
most convenient, it is nevertheless true that earlier
men managed at least fairly well on a different basis.
Then, too, the fact of the utility and universal applicability
of our present system, based upon universal
assent, does not obviate the conclusion that any other
system, consistent in itself, might be made to serve our
purposes as well.</p>

<p>It ought to be said, however, in justice to the rather
utilitarian results obtained by <span class="smcap">La Grange</span>, <span class="smcap">Helmholtz</span>,
<span class="smcap">Fechner</span>, and others who strove to make use
of their discoveries in analysis in solving mechanical,
physiological and other problems of more or less
pragmatic import that, in so far as this is true, mathematical
knowledge must be recognized as being consistent
with the necessities of <i>a priori</i> requirements.
But even these results may not be regarded as transcending
the scope of the most fundamental principles
of sense-experience. It will be discovered finally,
perhaps, that the energy spent in elaborating complicate
series of analytic curiosities has been misappropriated.
It will then be necessary to turn the attention
definitely to the study of that which lies not at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
terminus of the intellect's <i>modus vivendi</i>, but which
is both the origin of the intellect and its eternal sustainer&mdash;the
intuition, or life itself. This can result
in nothing less than the complete spiritualization of
man's mental outlook and the consequent inevitable
recognition of the underlying and ever-sustaining
<i>one-ness</i> of all vital manifestations.</p>

<p>One of the curiosities of the tendency in man's
mind to specialize in analytics, whether in the field of
pure mathematics or metaphysics, is the fact that it
almost invariably leads to an attempt to account for
cosmic origins on the basis of paralogic theories. This
in times past has given rise to the theory of the purely
mechanical origin of the universe as well as many
other fantastic fallacies the chief error of which lay
in the failure to distinguish between the realism of
mental concepts and that of the sensible world. In
spite of this, however, one is bound to appreciate the
beneficial effects of analytic operations because they
serve as invigorants to mental growth. It could not,
therefore, be wished that there were no such thing as
analytics; for the equilibria-restoring property of the
mind may at all times be relied upon to minimize the
danger of excesses in either direction. Just as the
tide flowing in flows out again, thereby restoring the
ocean's equilibrium, so the mind ascending in one
generation beyond the safety mark has its equilibrium
restored in the next by a relinquishment of the follies
of the former.</p>

<p>The four-space is one of the curiosities of analytics;
yet it need not be a menace to the sane contemplation
of the variegated products of analysis. Safety
here abides in the restraint which should characterize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
all discussion and application of the concept. If enthusiasts
would be content not to transport the so-called
fourth dimensional space out of the sphere of
hyperspace and cease trying to speculate upon the
results of its interposal into three space conditions,
which is in every way a constructual impossibility,
there could not be any possible objection to its due
consideration. This would obviate the danger of
calling into question either the sincerity or perspicacity
of those whose enthusiasm tempts them to transgress
the limits of propriety in their behavior towards the
inquiry.</p>

<p>There is but one life, one mind, one extension,
one quantity, one quality, one being, one state, one
condition, one mood, one affection, one desire, one
feeling, one consciousness. There is also but one
number and that is unity. All so-called integers are
but fractional parts of this kosmic unity. The idea
represented by the word <i>two</i> really connotates two
parts of unity and the same is true of a decillion, or
any number of parts. These are merely the infinitesimals
of unity and they grow less in size and
consequence as the divisions increase in number. The
analysis of unity into an infinity of parts is purely an
<i>a posteriori</i> procedure. That it is an inherent mind-process
is a fallacy. All our common quantities, as
the mile, kilometer, yard, foot, inch, gallon, quart, are
conventional and arbitrary and susceptible of wide
variations. As the basis of all physical phenomena
is unity; it is only in the ephemeral manifestations of
sensuous objects that they appear as separate and
distinct quantities.</p>

<p>We see on a tree many leaves, many apples or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
cherries; on a cob many grains of corn. We have
learned to assign to each of these quantities in their
summation a sequence value. But this is an empirical
notion and cannot be said to inhere in the mind itself.
Let us take, for instance, the mustard seed. If it
were true that in one of these seeds there existed all
the subsequent seeds which appear in the mustard
plant as separate and identifiable quantities, and not
in essence, then there would perhaps be warrant for
the notion that diversity, as the calculable element, is
an <i>a priori</i> conception. But, as this is not the case and
since diversity is purely empirical and pertains only to
the efflorescence of the one life it is manifestly absurd
to take that view.</p>

<p>Under the most charitable allowances, therefore,
there can be but two quantities&mdash;unity and diversity;
yet not two, for these are one. Unity is the <i>one</i>
quantity and diversity is the division of unity into a
transfinity of parts. Unity is infinite, absolute and
all-inclusive. Diversity is finite although it may be
admitted to be transfinite, or greater than any assignable
value. Unity alone is incomprehensible. In order
to understand something of its nature we divide it into
a diversity of parts; and because we fail to understand
the transfinity of the multitude of parts we mistakenly
call them infinite.</p>

<p>When analysis shall have proceeded far enough
into the abysmal mysteries of diversity; when the
mathematical mind shall have been overcome by the
overwhelming perplexity of the maze of diverse parts,
it shall then fall asleep and upon awaking shall find
that wonderfully simple thing&mdash;<i>unity</i>. It is the one
quantity that is endowed with a magnitude which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
both inconceivable and irresolvable. The one ineluctable
fact in the universe is the incomprehensibility
and all-inclusivity of <i>one-ness</i>. It is incomprehensible,
inconceivable and infinite at the present stage of mind
development. But the goal of mind is to understand
the essential character of unity, of life. Its evolution
will then stop, for it will have reached the prize of
divinity itself whereupon the intellect exalted by and
united with the intuition shall also become one with
the divine consciousness.</p>

the Properties of Analytic Spaces.</p></blockquote>


<p>The evolution of the idea of a fourth dimension
of space covers a long period of years. The earliest
known record of the beginnings of the study of space
is found in a hieratic papyrus which forms a part of
the Rhind Collection in the British Museum and which
has been deciphered by <span class="smcap">Eisenlohr</span>. It is believed
to be a copy of an older manuscript of date 3400 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>,
and is entitled "<i>Directions for Knowing All Dark
Things</i>" The copy is said to have been made by
<span class="smcap">Ahmes</span>, an Egyptian priest between 1700 and 1100
<span class="smcap">B. C.</span> It begins by giving the dimensions of barns;
then follows the consideration of various rectilineal
figures, circles, pyramids, and the value of pi ([Greek: p]).
Although many of the solutions given in the manuscript
have been found to be incorrect in minor particulars,
the fact remains that Egypt is really the
birth-place of geometry. And this fact is buttressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
by the knowledge that <span class="smcap">Thales</span>, long before he
founded the Ionian School which was the beginning
of Greek influence in the study of mathematics, is
found studying geometry and astronomy in Egypt.</p>

<p>The concept of hyperspace began to germinate in
the latter part of the first century, <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> For it was
at this date that <span class="smcap">Geminos</span> of <span class="smcap">Rhodes</span> (<span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 70) began
to think seriously of the mathematical labyrinth
into which <span class="smcap">Euclid's</span> parallel-postulate most certainly
would lead if an attempt at demonstrating its certitude
were made. He recognized the difficulties which
would engage the attention of those who might venture
to delve into the mysterious possibilities of the problem.
There is no doubt, too, but that <span class="smcap">Euclid</span> himself
was aware, in some measure at least, of these
difficulties; for his own attitude towards this postulate
seems to have been one of noncommittance. It is,
therefore, not strange that the astronomer, <span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span>
(<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 87-165), should be found seeking to prove the
postulate by a consideration of the possibilities of
interstellar triangles. His researches, however, brought
him no relief from the general dissatisfaction which
he felt with respect to the validity of the problem
itself.</p>

<p>For nearly one thousand years after the attempts
at solving the postulate by <span class="smcap">Geminos</span> and <span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span>, the
field of mathematics lay undisturbed. For it was at
this time that there arose a strange phenomenon,
more commonly known as the "Dark Ages," which
put an effectual check to further research or independent
investigations. Mathematicians throughout
this long lapse of time were content to accept <span class="smcap">Euclid</span>
as the one incontrovertible, unimpeachable authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and even such investigations as were made did not
have a rebellious tendence, but were mainly endeavors
to substantiate his claims.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it was not until about the first half
of the thirteenth century that any real advance was
made. At this time there appeared an Arab, <span class="smcap">Nasir-Eddin</span>
(1201-1274) who attempted to make an improvement
on the problem of parallelism. His work
on <span class="smcap">Euclid</span> was printed in Rome in 1594 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>, about
three hundred and twenty years after his demise and
was communicated in 1651 by <span class="smcap">John Wallis</span> (1616-1703)
to the mathematicians of Oxford University.
Although his calculations and conclusions were respectfully
received by the Oxford authorities no
definite results were regarded as accomplished by
what he had done. It is believed, however, that his
work reopened speculation upon the problem and
served as a basis, however slight, for the greater work
that was to be done by those who followed him during
the next succeeding eight hundred years.</p>

<p>About twenty years before the printing of the
work of <span class="smcap">Nasir-Eddin</span>, <span class="smcap">Christoph Clavius</span> (1574)
deduced the axiom of parallels from the assumption
that a line whose points are all equidistant from a
straight line is itself straight. In his consideration of
the parallel-postulate he is said to have regarded it
as <span class="smcap">Euclid's</span> XIIIth axiom. Later <span class="smcap">Bolyai</span> spoke of
it as the XIth and later still, <span class="smcap">Todhunter</span> treated it
as the XIIth. Hence, there does not seem to have
been any general unanimity of opinion as to the exact
status of the parallel-postulate, and especially is this
true in view of the uncertainty now known to have
existed in <span class="smcap">Euclid's</span> mind concerning it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girolamo Saccheri</span> (1667-1733), a learned
Jesuit, born at San Remo, came next upon the stage.
And so important was his work that it will perpetuate
the memory of his name in the history of mathematics.
He was a teacher of grammar in the Jesuit <i>Collegio
di Brera</i> where <span class="smcap">Tommaso Ceva</span>, a brother of <span class="smcap">Giovanni</span>,
the well-known mathematician, was teacher of
mathematics. His association with the <span class="smcap">Ceva</span> brothers
was especially beneficial to him. He made use of
<span class="smcap">Ceva's</span> very ingenious methods in his first published
book, 1693, entitled <i>Solutions of Six Geometrical
Problems Proposed by Count Roger Ventimiglia</i>.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig01.jpg" alt=""></img><br />
   <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 1.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Saccheri</span> attacked the problem of parallels in
quite a new way. Examining a quadrilateral, <i>ABCD</i>,
in which the angles <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are right angles and the
sides <i>AC</i> and <i>BD</i> are equal, he determined to show
that the angles <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are equal. He also sought
to prove that they are either right angles, obtuse or
acute. He undertook to prove the falsity of the latter
two propositions (that they are either obtuse or acute),
leaving as the only possibility that they must be right
angles. In doing so, he found that his assumptions
led him into contradictions which he experienced difficulty
in explaining.</p>

<p>His labors in connection with the solution of the
problems proposed by <span class="smcap">Count Ventimiglia</span>, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
his work on the question of parallels, led directly
into the field of metageometrical researches, and perhaps
to him as to no other who had preceded him,
or at least to him in a larger degree, belongs the credit
for a continued renewal of interest in that series of
investigations which resulted in the formulation of the
non-Euclidean geometry.</p>

<p>The last published work of <span class="smcap">Saccheri</span> was a recital
of his endeavors at demonstrating the parallel-postulate.
This received the "Imprimatur" of the Inquisition,
July 13, 1733; the Provincial Company of
Jesus took possession of the book for perusal on
August 16, 1733; but unfortunately within two months
after it had been reviewed by these authorities,
<span class="smcap">Saccheri</span> passed away.</p>

<p>All efforts which had been made prior to the work
of <span class="smcap">Saccheri</span> were based upon the assumption that
there must be an equivalent postulate which, if it could
be demonstrated, would lead to a direct, positive proof
of <span class="smcap">Euclid's</span> proposition. Although these and all
other attempts at reaching such a proof have signally
failed and although it may correctly be said that the
entire history of demonstrations aiming at the solution
of the famous postulate has been one long series
of utter failures, it can be asserted with equal certitude
that it has proven to be one of the most fruitful problems
in the history of mathematical thought. For out
of these failures has been built a superstructure of
analytical investigations which surpasses the most
sanguine expectations of those who had labored and
failed.</p>

<p>In 1766 <span class="smcap">John Lambert</span> (1728-1777) wrote a
paper upon the <i>Theory of Parallels</i> dated Sept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
5, 1766, first published in 1786, from the papers left
by <span class="smcap">F. Bernoulli</span>, which contained the following
assertions:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>1. The parallel-axiom needs proof, since it does
not hold for geometry on the surface of the sphere.</p>

<p>2. In order to make intuitive a geometry in which
the triangle's sum is less than two right angles, we
need an "imaginary" sphere (the pseudosphere).</p>

<p>3. In a space in which the triangle's sum is different
from two right angles there is an absolute measure
(a natural unit for length).</p>

<p>At this time <span class="smcap">Immanuel Kant</span> (1724-1804), the
noted German metaphysician, was in the midst of his
philosophical labors. And it is believed that it was
he who first suggested the idea of different <i>spaces</i>.
Below is given a statement taken from his <i>Prolegomena</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
which corroborates this view.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That complete space (which is itself no longer
the boundary of another space) has three dimensions,
and that space in general cannot have more,
is based on the proposition that not more than three
lines can intersect at right angles in one point....
That we can require a line to be drawn to infinity,
a series of changes to be continued (for example,
<i>spaces</i> passed through by motion) in indefinitum,
presupposes a representation of space and time
which can only attach to intuition."</p></blockquote>

<p>His differentiation between space in general and
space which may be considered as the "boundary of
another space" shows, in the light of the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
developments of the mathematical idea of space that
he very fully appreciated the marvelous scope of
analytic spaces. His conception of space, therefore,
must have had a profound influence upon the mathematic
thought of the day causing it to undergo a rapid
reconstruction at the hands of geometers who came
after him.</p>

<p>Under the masterly influence of <span class="smcap">La Grange</span>
(1736-1813) the idea of different spaces began to take
definite shape and direction; the geometry of hyperspace
began to crystallize; and the field of mathesis
prepared for the growth of a conception the comprehension
of which was destined to be the profoundest
undertaking ever attempted by the human
mind. Unlike most great men whom the world learns
tardily to admire, <span class="smcap">La Grange</span> lived to see his talents
and genius fully recognized by his compeers; for he
was the recipient of many honors both from his
countrymen and his admirers in foreign lands. He
spent twenty years in Prussia where he went upon the
invitation of <span class="smcap">Frederick</span> the Great who in the Royal
summons referred to himself as the "greatest king
in Europe" and to <span class="smcap">La Grange</span> as the "greatest
mathematician" in Europe. In Prussia the <i>Mecanique
Analytique</i> and a long series of memoirs which were
published in the Berlin and Turin Transactions were
produced. <span class="smcap">La Grange</span> did not exhibit any marked
taste for mathematics until he was 17 years of age.
Soon thereafter he came into possession of a memoir
by <span class="smcap">Halley</span> quite by accident and this so aroused his
latent genius that within one year after he had reviewed
<span class="smcap">Halley's</span> memoir he became an accomplished
mathematician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>He created the calculus of variations, solved most
of the problems proposed by Fermat, adding a number
of theorems of his own contrivance; raised the
theory of differential equations to the position of a
science rather than a series of ingenious methods for
the solution of special problems and furnished a solution
for the famous isoperimetrical problem which
had baffled the skill of the foremost mathematicians
for nearly half a century. All these stupendous tasks
he performed by the time he reached the age of
nineteen.</p>

<p>The <i>Mecanique Analytique</i> is his greatest and
most comprehensive work. In this he established the
law of virtual work from which, by the aid of his
calculus of variations, he deduced the whole of
mechanics, including both solids and liquids. It was
his object in the <i>Analytique</i> to show that the whole subject
of mechanics is implicitly embraced in a single
principle, and to lay down certain formulae from which
any particular result can be obtained. He frequently
made the assertion that he had, in the <i>Mecanique
Analytique</i>, transformed mechanics which he persistently
defined as a "geometry of four dimensions"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
into a branch of analytics and had shown the so-called
mechanical principles to be the simple results of the
calculus. Hence, there can be no doubt but that <span class="smcap">La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Grange</span> not only completed the foundation, but provided
most of the material in his analyses and other
"abstract results of great generality" which he obtained
in his numerous calculations, for the superstructure
subsequently known as the geometry of
hyperspace, and in which the fourth dimensional concept
occupies a very fundamental place.</p>

<p>It is as if for nearly seventeen hundred years workmen,
such as <span class="smcap">Geminos</span>, of <span class="smcap">Rhodes</span>, <span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span>, <span class="smcap">Saccheri</span>,
<span class="smcap">Nasir-Eddin</span>, <span class="smcap">Lambert</span>, <span class="smcap">Clavius</span>, and hundred
of others who struggled with the problem of
parallels, had made more or less sporadic attempts at
the excavation of the land whereon a marvelously
intricate building was to be constructed. There is no
historical evidence to show that any of them ever
dreamed that the results of their labors would be
utilized in the manner in which they have been used.
Then came <span class="smcap">Kant</span> with the wonderfully penetrating
searchlight of his masterful intellect who from the
elevation which he occupied saw that the site had great
possibilities, but he had not the mathematical talent
to undertake the work of actual, methodical construction.
Indeed his task was of a different sort. However,
he succeeded in opening the way for <span class="smcap">La Grange</span>
and others who followed him. <span class="smcap">La Grange</span> immediately
seized upon the idea which for more than a
thousand years had been impinging upon the minds
of mathematicians vainly seeking lodgment and began
the elaboration of a plan in accordance with which
minds better skilled in the pragmatic application of
abstract principles than his could complete the work
begun. Unfortunately, on account of his intense devotion
and loyalty to the study of pure mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and when he had reached the summit of his greatness
where he stood "without a rival as the foremost living
mathematician," his health became seriously affected,
causing him to suffer constant attacks of profound
melancholia from which he died on April 10, 1813.</p>

<p>We come now to one of the most remarkable
periods in the history of mental development. During
the six hundred years between the birth of <span class="smcap">Nasir-Eddin</span>
and the death of <span class="smcap">La Grange</span> the entire world
of mathesis was being reconstituted. Since there had
been gradually going on an internal process which,
when completed, forever would liberate the mind
from the narrow confines of consciousness limited to
the three-space, it is not surprising that we should find,
in the mathematical thought of the time, an absolutely
epoch-making departure. The innumerable attempts
at the solution of the parallel-postulate, all failures in
the sense that they did not prove, have intensified
greatly the esteem in which the never-dying elements
of <span class="smcap">Euclid</span> are held to-day. And despite the fact that
there may come a time when his axioms and conclusions
may be found to be incongruent with the facts
of sensuous reality; and though all of his fundamental
conceptions of space in general, his theorems, propositions
and postulates may have to give way before the
searching glare of a deeper knowledge because of
some revealed fault, the perfection of his work in
the realm of pure mathematics will remain forever a
master piece demanding the undiminished admiration
of mankind.</p>

<p>The parallel-postulate, as stated by <span class="smcap">Euclid</span> in his
<i>Elements of Geometry</i>, reads as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If a straight line meet two straight lines so as
to make the two interior angles on the same side
of it taken together less than two right angles,
these straight lines being continually produced, shall
at length meet upon that side on which are the
angles which are less than two right angles."</p></blockquote>

<p>On this postulate hang all the "law and the
prophets" of the non-Euclidean Geometry. In it
are the virtual elements of three possible geometries.
Furthermore, it is both the warp and the woof of
the loom of present-day metageometrical researches.
It is the golden egg laid by the god <span class="smcap">Seb</span> at the beginning
of a new life cycle in psychogenesis. Its
progeny are numerous&mdash;hyperspaces, sects, straights,
digons, equidistantials, polars, planars, coplanars, invariants,
quaternions, complex variables, groups and
many others. A wonderfully interesting breed, full
of meaning and pregnant with the power of final
emancipations for the human intellect!</p>

<p>When the conclusions which were systematically
formulated as a result of the investigations along the
lines of hypotheses which controverted the parallel-postulate
were examined it was found that they fell
into three main divisions, namely: the synthetic or
hyperbolic; the analytic or <span class="smcap">Riemannian</span> and the
elliptic or <span class="smcap">Cayley-Klein</span>. These divisions or groups
are based upon the three possibilities which inhere in
the conception taken of the sum of the angles referred
to in the above postulate as to whether it is equal to,
greater or less than two right angles.</p>

<p>The assumption that the angular sum is congruent
to a straight angle is called the Euclidean or parabolic
hypothesis and is to be distinguished from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
synthetic or hyperbolic hypothesis established by
<span class="smcap">Gauss</span>, <span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span> and <span class="smcap">Bolyai</span> and which assumes
that the angular sum is less than a straight angle.
The elliptic or <span class="smcap">Cayley-Klein</span> hypothesis assumes that
the angular sum is greater than a straight angle.
<span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>, however, not satisfied with the statement
of the parallel-postulate as given by <span class="smcap">Euclid</span> and
which had caused the age-long controversy, substituted
for it the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All straight lines which, in a plane, radiate
from a given point, can, with respect to any other
straight line, in the same plane, be divided into two
classes&mdash;the intersecting and the non-intersecting.
The boundary line of the one and the other class
is called parallel to the given line."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is but another way of saying about the same
thing that <span class="smcap">Euclid</span> had declared before, and yet, curiously
enough it afforded just the liberty that <span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>
needed to enable him to elaborate his theory.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this sketch the field of the
development of non-Euclidean geometry is divided
into three periods to be known as: (1) the <i>formative</i>
period in which mathematical thought was being
formulated for the new departure; (2) the <i>determinative</i>
period during which the mathematical ideas were
given direction, purpose and a general tendence; (3)
the <i>elaborative</i> period during which the results of the
former periods were elaborated into definite kinds of
geometries and attempts made at popularizing the
hypotheses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>The Formative Period</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Frederich Gauss</span> (1777-1855) by
some has been regarded as the most influential mathematician
that figured in the formulation of the non-Euclidean
geometry; but closer examination into his
efforts at investigating the properties of a triangle
shows that while his researches led to the establishment
of the theorem that a regular polygon of seventeen
sides (or of any number which is prime, and
also one more than a power of two) can be inscribed,
under the Euclidean restrictions as to means, in a
circle, and also that the common spherical angle on
the surface of a sphere is closely connected with the
constitution of the area inclosed thereby, he cannot
justly be designated as the leader of those who formulated
the synthetic school. And this, too, for the
simple reason that, as he himself admits in one of
his letters to <span class="smcap">Taurinus</span>, he had not "published anything
on the subject." In this same letter he informs
<span class="smcap">Taurinus</span> that he had pondered the subject for more
than thirty years and expressed the belief that there
could not be any one who had "concerned himself more
exhaustively with this second part (that the sum of
the angles of a triangle cannot be more than 180 degrees)"
than he had.</p>

<p>Writing from Göttingen to <span class="smcap">Taurinus</span>, November
8, 1824, and commenting upon the geometric value of
the sum of the angles of a triangle, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your presentation of the demonstration that
the sum of the angles of a plane triangle cannot be
greater than 180 degrees does, indeed, leave some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>thing
to be desired in point of geometrical precision.
But this could be supplied, and there is no doubt
that the impossibility in question admits of the most
rigorous demonstration. But the case is quite different
with the second part, namely, that the sum
of the angles cannot be smaller than 180 degrees;
this is the real difficulty, the rock upon which all
endeavors are wrecked.... The assumption that
the sum of the three angles is smaller than 180
degrees leads to a new geometry entirely different
from our Euclidean&mdash;a geometry which is throughout
consistent with itself, and which I have elaborated
in a manner entirely satisfactory to myself,
so that I can solve every problem in it with the exception
of the determining of a constant which is
not <i>a priori</i> obtainable."</p></blockquote>

<p>It appears from this correspondence that <span class="smcap">Gauss</span>
had in the privacy of his own study elaborated a complete
non-Euclidean geometry, and had so thoroughly
familiarized himself with its characteristics and possibilities
that the solution of every problem embraced
within it was very clear to him except that of the
determination of a constant. He concluded the above
letter by saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All my endeavors to discover contradiction or
inconsistencies in this non-Euclidean geometry have
been in vain, and the only thing in it that conflicts
with our reason is the fact that if it were true there
would necessarily exist in space a linear magnitude
quite determinate in itself; yet unknown to us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Judging from the correspondence between <span class="smcap">Gauss</span>
and <span class="smcap">Gerling</span> (1788-1857), <span class="smcap">Bessel</span> (1784-1846),
<span class="smcap">Schumacher</span> and <span class="smcap">Taurinus</span>, the nephew of <span class="smcap">Schwei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>kart</span>,
and that between <span class="smcap">Schweikart</span> and <span class="smcap">Gerling</span>,
there had grown up a general dissatisfaction in the
minds of mathematicians of this period with Euclidean
geometry and especially the parallel-postulate and its
connotations. <span class="smcap">Bessel</span> expresses this general discontent
in one of his letters to <span class="smcap">Gauss</span>, dated February 10,
1829, in which he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Through that which <span class="smcap">Lambert</span> said and what
<span class="smcap">Schweikart</span> disclosed orally, it has become clear
to me that our geometry is incomplete, and should
receive a correction, which is hypothetical, and if
the sum of the angles of the plane triangle is equal
to 180 degrees, vanishes."</p></blockquote>

<p>The opinion of leading mathematicians at this time
seems to have been crystallizing very rapidly. Unconsciously
the men of this formative period were
adducing evidence which would give form and tendence
to the developments in the field of mathesis at a later
date. They appear to have been reaching out for
that which, ignis fatuus-like, was always within easy
reach, but not quite apprehensible.</p>

<p>A bolder student than <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> was <span class="smcap">Ferdinand
Carl Schweikart</span> (1780-1857) who also has been
credited with the founding of the non-Euclidean
geometry. In fact, if judged by the same standards
as <span class="smcap">Gauss</span>, he would be called the "father of the
geometry of hyperspace"; for he really published the
first treatise on the subject. This was in the nature
of an inclosure which he inserted between the leaves
of a book he loaned to <span class="smcap">Gerling</span>. He also asked that
it be shown to <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> that he might give his judgment
as to its merits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schweikart's</span> treatise, dated Marburg, December,
1818, is here quoted in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is a two-fold geometry&mdash;a geometry in
the narrower sense, the Euclidean, and an astral
science of magnitude.</p>

<p>"The triangles of the latter have the peculiarity
that the sum of the three angles is not equal to two
right angles.</p>

<p>"This presumed, it can be most rigorously
proven: (<i>a</i>) That the sum of the three angles in
the triangle is less than two right angles.</p>

<p>"(<i>b</i>) That this sum becomes ever smaller, the
more content the angle incloses. (<i>c</i>) That the altitude
of an isosceles right-angled triangle indeed ever
increases, the more one lengthens the side; that it,
however, cannot surpass a certain line which I call
the constant."</p>

<p>Squares have consequently the following form:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig02.jpg" alt=""></img><br />
   <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 2.</span>
</div>

<p>"If this constant were for us the radius of the
earth (so that every line drawn in the universe, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
one fixed star to another, distant 90° from the first,
would be a tangent to the surface of the earth) it
would be infinitely great in comparison with the
spaces which occur in daily life."</p></blockquote>

<p>The above, being the first published, not printed,
treatise on the new geometry occupies a unique place
in the history of higher mathematics. It gave additional
strength to the formative tendencies which
characterized this period and marked <span class="smcap">Schweikart</span> as
a constructive and original thinker.</p>

<p>The nascent aspects of this stage received a fruitful
contribution when <span class="smcap">Nicolai Lobachevski</span> (1793-1847)
created his <i>Imaginary Geometry</i> and <span class="smcap">Janos
Bolyai</span> (1802-1860) published as an appendix to his
father's <i>Tentamen</i>, his <i>Science Absolute of Space</i>.
<span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span> and <span class="smcap">Bolyai</span> have been called the
"Creators of the Non-Euclidean Geometry." And this
appellation seems richly to be deserved by these
pioneers. Their work gave just the impetus most
needed to fix the status of the new line of researches
which led to such remarkable discoveries in the more
recent years. The <i>Imaginary Geometry</i> and the
<i>Science Absolute of Space</i> were translated by the
French mathematician, <span class="smcap">J. Hoüel</span> in 1868 and by him
elevated out of their forty-five years of obscurity and
non-effectiveness to a position where they became available
for the mathematical public. To <span class="smcap">Bolyai</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>, consequently, belong the honor of
starting the movement which resulted in the development
of metageometry and hence that which has
proved to be the gateway of a new mathematical freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gauss</span>, <span class="smcap">Schweikart</span>, <span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>, <span class="smcap">Wolfgang</span>
and <span class="smcap">Janos Bolyai</span> were the principal figures of the
formative period and the value of their work with
respect to the formulation of principles upon which
was constructed the Temple of Metageometry cannot
be overestimated.</p>


<p class="center"><b>The Determinative Period</b></p>

<p>This period is characterized chiefly by its close
relationship to the theory of surfaces. <span class="smcap">Riemann's</span>
Habilitation Lecture on <i>The Hypotheses Which Constitute
the Bases of Geometry</i> marks the beginning of
this epoch. In this dissertation, <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> not only
promulgated the system upon which <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> had spent
more than thirty years of his life in elaborating, for
he was a disciple of <span class="smcap">Gauss</span>; but he disclosed his own
views with respect to space which he regarded as a
particular case of manifold. His work contains two
fundamental concepts, namely, the <i>manifold</i> and the
<i>measure of curvature</i> of a continuous manifold, possessed
of what he called <i>flatness</i> in the smallest parts.
The conception of the measure of curvature is extended
by <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> from surfaces to spaces and a
new kind of space, finite, but unbounded, is shown
to be possible. He showed that the dimensions of
any space are determined by the number of measurements
necessary to establish the position of a point in
that space. Conceiving, therefore, that space is a manifold
of finite, but unbounded, extension, he established
the fact that the passage from one element of a manifold
to another may be either discrete or continuous and
that the manifold is discrete or continuous according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to the manner of passage. Where the manifold is
regarded as discrete two portions of it can be compared,
as to magnitude, by counting; where continuous,
by measurement. If the whole manifold be caused to
pass over into another manifold each of its elements
passing through a one-dimensional manifold, a two-dimensional
manifold is thus generated. In this way,
a manifold of <i>n</i>-dimensions can be generated. On the
other hand, a manifold of <i>n</i>-dimensions can be analyzed
into one of one dimension and one of (<i>n</i>-1)
dimensions.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">Riemann</span>, then, is due the credit for first
promulgating the idea that space being a special case
of manifold is generable, and therefore, <i>finite</i>. He
laid the foundation for the establishment of a special
kind of geometry known as the "elliptic." Space, as
viewed by him, possessed the following properties,
viz.: generability, divisibility, measurability, ponderability,
finity and flexity.</p>

<p>These are the six pillars upon which rests the
structure of hyperspace analyses.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><i>Generability</i> is that property of geometric space
by virtue of which it may be generated, or constructed,
by the movement of a line, plane, surface
or solid in a direction without itself. <i>Divisibility</i> is
that property of geometric space by virtue of which
it may be segmented or divided into separate parts
and superposed, or inserted, upon or between each
other. <i>Measurability</i> is that property by virtue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
which geometric space is determined to be a manifold
of either a positive or negative curvature, also by
which its extent may be measured. <i>Ponderability</i> is
that property of geometric space by virtue of which it
may be regarded as a quantity which can be manipulated,
assorted, shelved or otherwise disposed of.
<i>Finity</i> is that property by virtue of which geometric
space is limited to the scope of the individual consciousness
of a unodim, a duodim or a tridim and by
virtue of which it is finite in extent. <i>Flexity</i> is that
property by virtue of which geometric space is regarded
as possessing curvature, and in consequence of
which progress through it is made in a curved, rather
than a geodetic line, also by virtue of which it may be
flexed without disruption or dilatation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riemann</span> who thus prepared the way for entrance
into a veritable labyrinth of hyperspaces is, therefore,
correctly styled "The father of metageometry," and
the fourth dimension is his eldest born. He died while
but forty years of age and never lived long enough
fully to elaborate his theory with respect to its application
to the measure of curvature of space. This
was left for his very energetic disciple, <span class="smcap">Eugenio
Beltrami</span> (1835-1900) who was born nine years
after <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> and lived thirty-four years longer
than he. His labors mark the characteristic standpoint
of the determinative period. <span class="smcap">Beltrami's</span> mathematical
investigations were devoted mainly to the
non-Euclidean geometry. These led him to the rather
remarkable conclusion that the propositions embodied
therein relate to figures lying upon surfaces of constant
negative curvature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beltrami</span> sought to show that such surfaces partake
of the nature of the pseudosphere, and in doing

<p>If the plane figure <i>aabb</i> is made to revolve upon
its axis of symmetry <i>AB</i> the two arcs, <i>ab</i> and <i>ab</i> will
describe a pseudospherical concave-convex surface like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
that of a solid anchor ring. Above and below, toward
<i>aa</i> and <i>bb</i>, the surface will turn outward with
ever-increasing flexure till it becomes perpendicular to
the axis and ends at the edge with one curvature infinite.
Or, the half of a pseudospherical surface may
be rolled up into the shape of a champagne glass, as
in Fig. 4. In this way, the two straightest lines of
the pseudospherical surface may be indefinitely produced,
giving a kind of space (pseudospherical) in
which the axiom of parallels does not hold true.</p>

<p>The determinative period marks the most important
stage in the development of non-Euclidean
geometry and certainly the most significant in the evolution
of the idea of hyperspaces and multiple dimensionality.
<span class="smcap">Riemann</span> and <span class="smcap">Beltrami</span> are chief among
those whose labors characterize the scope of this
period. Their work gave direction and general outline
for later developments and all subsequent researches
along these lines have been conducted in strict
conformity with the principles laid down by these
pioneer constructionists. They laid out the field and
designated its confines beyond which no adventurer has
since dared to pass.</p>

<p>The great importance of the work of <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> at
this time may be seen further in the fact that it not
only marked the beginning of a new epoch in geometry;
but his pronouncement of the hypothesis that space is
unbounded, though finite, is really the first time in
the history of human thought that expression was ever
given to the idea that space may yet be only of limited
extent. Before that time the minds of all men seemed
to have been unanimous in the consideration of space
as an illimitable and infinite quantity.</p>

<p class="center"><b>The Elaborative Period</b></p>

<p>The elaborative stage includes the work of all
those who, working upon the bases laid down by
<span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>, <span class="smcap">Bolyai</span>, <span class="smcap">SchweikarT</span> and <span class="smcap">Riemann</span>,
have sought to amplify the conclusions reached by
them. Among those whose investigations have greatly
multiplied the applications of hyperspace conceptions
are <span class="smcap">Hoüel</span> (1866) and <span class="smcap">Flye St. Marie</span> (1871) of
France; <span class="smcap">Helmholtz</span> (1868), <span class="smcap">Frischauf</span> (1872),
<span class="smcap">Klein</span> (1849), and <span class="smcap">Baltzer</span> (1877) of Germany;
<span class="smcap">Beltrami</span> (1872) of Italy; <span class="smcap">De Tilly</span> (1879) of Belgium;
<span class="smcap">Clifford</span> and <span class="smcap">Cayley</span> (1821) of England;
<span class="smcap">Newcomb</span> (1835) and <span class="smcap">Halstead</span> of America.</p>

<p>These have been most active in popularizing the
subject of non-Euclidean geometry and incidentally the
idea of the fourth dimension. The great mass of
non-professional mathematical readers, therefore, owe
these men an immeasurable debt of gratitude for the
work that they have done in the matter of rendering
the conceptions which constitute the fabric of metageometry
understandable and thinkable. A glance at
the bibliography appended at the end of this volume
will give some idea of the enormous amount of labor
that has been expended in an effort to translate the
most abstract mathematical principles into a language
that could easily be comprehended by the average intelligent
person.</p>

<p>The characteristic standpoint of this period is the
popular comprehension of the hyperspace concept and
the consequent mental liberation which follows. For
there is no doubt but that unheard of possibilities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
thought have been revealed by investigations into the
nature of space. An entirely new world has been
opened to view and only a beginning has been made
at the exploration of its extent and resources.</p>

<p>One of the notable incidents of the early years of
this period is the position taken by <span class="smcap">Felix Klein</span> who
stands in about the same relation to <span class="smcap">Cayley</span> as
<span class="smcap">Beltrami</span> does to <span class="smcap">Riemann</span>, in that he assumed the
task of completing the work of his predecessor.
<span class="smcap">Klein</span> held that there are only two kinds of <span class="smcap">Riemannian</span>
<i>space</i>&mdash;the elliptical and the spherical. Or
in other words, that there are only two possible kinds
of space in which the propositions announced by
<span class="smcap">Riemann</span> could apply. <span class="smcap">Sophus Lie</span>, called the "great
comparative anatomist of geometric theories," carried
his classifications to a final conclusion in connection
with spaces of all kinds and decided that there are
possible only four kinds of three dimensional spaces.</p>

<p>But whether men with peering, microscopic, histological
vision shall establish the existence of one or
many spaces, and regardless of the mathematic rigor
with which they shall demonstrate the self-consistency
of the doctrines which they hold, the fact remains that
the hypotheses thus maintained, while they may be
regarded as true descriptions of the spaces concerned,
are, nevertheless, incompatible. All of them cannot
be valid. It will perhaps be found that none of them
are valid, especially objectively so. The only true
view, therefore, of these systems of hyperspaces is
that which assigns them to their rightful place in the
infinitely vast world of pure mathesis where their
validity may go unchallenged and their existence unquestioned;
for in that domain of unconfined menta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>tion,
in that realm of divine intuitability, the marvelous
wonderland of ideas and notions, one is not only
disinclined to doubt their logical actuality, but is quite
willing to accede their claims.</p>

<p>The term "non-Euclidean" is used to designate
any system of geometry which is not strictly Euclidean
in content.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how the term came to be
used. It appears to have been employed first by
<span class="smcap">Gauss</span>. He did not strike upon it suddenly, however,
as in the correspondence between him and <span class="smcap">Wachter</span>
in 1816 he used the designation "anti-Euclidean" and
then, later, following <span class="smcap">Schweikart</span>, he adopted the
latter's terminology and called it "Astral Geometry."
This he found in <span class="smcap">Schweikart's</span> first published
<i>treatise</i> known by that name and which made its appearance
at Marburg in December, 1818. Finally,
in his correspondence with <span class="smcap">Taurinus</span> in 1824, <span class="smcap">Gauss</span>
first used the expression "non-Euclidean" to designate
the system which he had elaborated and continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
use it in his correspondence with <span class="smcap">Schumacher</span> in
1831.</p>

<p>"Non-Legendrean," "semi-Euclidean" and "non-Archimedean"
are titles used by <span class="smcap">M. Dehn</span> to denote
all kinds of geometries which represented variations
from the hypotheses laid down by <span class="smcap">Legendre</span>, <span class="smcap">Euclid</span>
and <span class="smcap">Archimedes</span>.</p>

<p>The semi-Euclidean is a system of geometry in
which the sum of the angles of a triangle is said to
be equal to two right angles, but in which one may
draw an infinity of parallels to a straight line through
a given point. The non-Euclidean geometry embraces
all the results obtained as a consequence of efforts
made at finding a satisfactory proof of the parallel-postulate
and is, therefore, based upon a conception
of space which is at variance with that held by
<span class="smcap">Euclid</span>. According to the Ionian school space is an
infinite continuum possessing uniformity throughout
its entire extent. The non-Euclideans maintain that
space is not an infinite extension; but a finite though
unbounded manifold capable of being generated by
the movement of a point, line or plane in a direction
without itself. It is also held that space is curved
and exists in the shape of a sphere or pseudosphere
and is consequently elliptical.</p>

<p>The inapplicability of <span class="smcap">Euclid</span>'s parallel-postulate
to lines drawn upon the surface of a sphere suggested
the possibility of a space in which the postulate could
apply to all possible surfaces or that space itself may
be spherical in which case the postulate would be invalidated
altogether. Hence, it is quite natural that
mathematicians finding themselves unable to prove the
postulate with due mathetic precision should turn their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
attention to the conceptually possible. In this virtual
abandonment of the perceptual for the conceptual lies
the fundamental difference between the Euclidean and
the non-Euclidean geometries. It may be said to the
credit of the Euclideans that they have sought to make
their geometric conceptions conform as closely as
possible to the actual nature of things in the sensuous
world while at the same time they must have perceived
that at best their spatial notions were only approximations
to the sensuous actuality of objects in
space.</p>

<p>On the other hand, non-Euclideans make no pretense
at discovering any congruency between their
notions and things as they actually are. The attitude
of the metageometricians in this respect is very aptly
described by <span class="smcap">Cassius Jackson Keyser</span> who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He constructs in thought a summitless hierarchy
of hyperspaces, an endless series of orderly
worlds, worlds that are possible and logically actual,
and he is content not to know if any of them be
otherwise actual or actualized."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The non-Euclidean is, therefore, not concerned
about the applicability of ensembles, notions and
propositions to real, perceptual space conditions. It
is sufficient for him to know that his creations are
thinkable. As soon as he can resolve the nebulosity
of his consciousness into the conceptual "star-forms"
of definite ideas and notions, he sits down to the feast
which he finds provided by superfoetated hypotheses
fabricated in the deeps of mind and logical actualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
imperturbed and unmindful of the weal of perceptual
space in its homogeneity of form and dimensionality.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the non-Euclidean geometry is constructed
upon the basis of conceptual space almost
entirely. Knowledge of its content is accordingly
derived from a superperceptual representation of relations
and interrelations subsisting between and
among notions, ideas, propositions and magnitudes
arising out of a conceptual consideration thereof. In
other words, representations of the non-Euclidean
magnitudes, cannot be said to be strictly perceptual
in the same sense that three-space magnitudes are
perceived; for three-space magnitudes are really sense
objects while hyperspace magnitudes are not sense objects.
They are far removed from the sensuous world
and in order to conceive them one must raise his
consciousness from the sensuous plane to the conceptual
plane and become aware of a class of perceptions
which are not perceptions in the strict sense of the
word, but superperceptions; because they are representations
of concepts rather than precepts.</p>

<p>Notions of perceptual space are constituted of the
triple presentations arising out of the visual, tactual
and motor sensations which are fused together in their
final delivery to the consciousness. The synthesis of
these three sense-deliveries is accomplished by equilibrating
their respective differences and by correcting
the perceptions of one sense by those of another
in such a way as to obtain a completely reliable perception
of the object. This is the manner in which
the characteristics of Euclidean space are established.</p>

<p>The characteristics of non-Euclidean space are not
arrived at exactly in this way. Being beyond the scope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of the visual, tactile and motor sense apprehensions, it
cannot be said to represent judgments derived from
any consideration or elaboration of the deliveries
presented through these media. Yet, the substance of
metageometry, or the science of the measurement of
hyperspaces, may not be regarded as an <i>a priori</i> substructure
upon which the system is founded. That is,
the conceptual space of non-Euclidean geometry is not
presented to the consciousness as an <i>a priori</i> notion.
On the other hand, the <i>a posterioristic</i> quality of
metageometric spaces marks the entire scope of motility
of the notions appertaining thereto.</p>

<p>The notions, therefore, of conceptual space are derivable
only from the perception of concepts, or,
otherwise consist of judgments concerning interconceptual
relations. The process of apperception involved
in the recognition of relations which may be
methodically determined is much removed from the
primary procedure of perceiving sense-impressions and
fusing them into final deliveries to the consciousness
for conceptualization or the elaboration into concepts
or general notions. It is a procedure which is in
every way superconceptual and extra-sensuous. The
metageometrician or analyst in no way relies upon
sense-deliveries for the data of his constructions; for,
if he did, he should, then, be reduced to the necessity
of confining his conclusions to the sphere of motility
imposed by the sensible world with the result that we
should be able to verify empirically all his postulations.
But, contrarily, he goes to the extra-sensuous,
and there in the realm of pure conceptuality, he finds
the requisite freedom for his theories; thus, environed
by a sort of intellectual anarchism, he pursues ana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>lytical
pleasures quite unrestrainedly. The difference
between the two mental processes&mdash;that which leads
from the sensible world to conception and that which
veers into the fields beyond&mdash;is so great that it is
hardly permissible to view the results arrived at in
the outcome of the separate processes as being
identical.</p>

<p>To illustrate this difference, let us draw an analogy.
The miner digs the iron ore out of the ground. The
iron is separated from the extraneous material and
delivered to the furnaces where the metal is melted
and turned out as pig iron. It is further treated, and
steel, of various grades, cast iron and other kinds of
iron are produced. The treatment of the iron ore
up to this stage is similar to the treatment of sense-impressions
by the Thinker. Steel, cast iron, et cetera,
are similar to mental concepts. Later, the steel and
other products are converted into instruments and
numerous articles. This represents the superperceptual
process. Trafficking in iron ore products, such as
instruments of precision, watch springs, and the like,
represents a stage still farther removed from the
primary treatment of the ore and is similar to that
to which concepts are treated when the metageometrician
manipulates them in the construction of conceptual
space-forms. Perception is the dealing with raw iron
ore while conception is analogous to the production
of the finished product.</p>

<p>Superperception would be analogous to the trafficking
in the finished product as such and without any
reference to the source or the preceding processes.
Thus the notions and judgments of the non-Euclidean
geometry are arrived at as a result of a triple process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of perception, conception and superperception the latter
being merely superconceived as formal space-notions.
But it is obvious that the more complex the processes
by which judgments purporting to relate to perceptual
things are derived the more likely are those judgments
to be at variance with the nature of the things themselves.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing, the dangers resulting
from identifying the products of the two processes
are very obvious indeed. But the difference between
the two procedures is the difference between Euclidean
and non-Euclidean geometries or the difference between
perceptual space notions and conceptual space
notions. Hence, it is not understood just how or why
it has occurred to anyone that the two notions could
be made congruent. Magnitudes in perceptual, sensible
space are things apart from those that may be
said to exist in mathematical space or that space whose
qualities and properties have no existence outside of
the mind which has conceived them. It is believed to
be quite impossible to approach the study of metageometrical
propositions with a clear, open mind without
previously understanding the fundamental distinctions
which exist between them.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, as a logical conclusion that
geometric space of whatsoever nature is a purely
formal construction of the intellect, and for this reason
is completely under the sovereignty of the intellect
however whimsical its demands may be. Being thus
the creature of the intellect, its possibilities are limited
only by the limitations of the intellect itself. Perceptual
space, being neither the creature of the intellect
nor necessarily an <i>a priori</i> notion resident in the mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
substructure, but existing entirely independent of the
intellect or its apprehension thereof, cannot be expected
to conform to the purely formal restrictions
imposed by the mind except in so far as those restrictions
may be determined by the nature of perceptual
space. And for that matter, it should not be
forgotten that, as yet, we have no means of determining
whether or not the testimony of the intellect is
thoroughly credible simply because there is no other
standard by which we may prove its testimony. It is
possible to justify the deliveries of the eye by the sense
of touch, or vice versa. It is also possible to prove
all our sense-deliveries by one or the other of the
senses. But we have no such good fortune with the
deliveries of the intellect. We have simply to accept
its testimony as final; because we cannot do any better.
But if it were possible to correct the testimony of
the intellect by some other faculty or power which
by nature might be more accurate than the intellect
it should be found that the intellect itself is sadly
limited.</p>

<p>The possible curvature of space is a notion which
also characterizes the content of the non-Euclidean
geometry. It is upon this notion that the question of
the finity and unboundedness of space, in the mathematical
sense, rests. In the curved space, the straightest
line is a curved line which returns upon itself.
Progression eastward brings one to the west; progression
northward brings one to the south, et cetera.
On this view space is finite, but may not be regarded
as possessing boundaries.</p>

<p>Space-curvature, reinforced by the idea that space
is also a manifold is the enabling clause of meta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>geometry
and without them the analyst dares not proceed.
Here again, we are led to the confession that
however fantastic these two notions may seem and
evidently are, there is nevertheless to be recognized in
them a "dim glimpse" of a veritable reality&mdash;a slight
foreshadowing of the revelation of some great kosmic
mystery.</p>

<p>The manifoldness of space is the fiat of analysis.
It is the inevitable outcome of the analyst's method
of procedure. His education, training and view of
things in general inhibit his arriving at any other result
and he may be pardoned with good grace for his
manufacture of the space-manifold. For by it perhaps
a better appreciation of that wonderful extension
of consciousness in the nature of which is involved the
explanation of the perplexing problems which the
manifold and other metageometrical expedients faintly
adumbrate may be gained.</p>

<p>It is pertinent, in the light of the above, to examine
into some of the relative merits of the three
formal bulwarks of geometrical knowledge. These
are <i>certainty</i>, <i>necessity</i> and <i>universality</i>.</p>

<p>Geometric certainty is derived solely from the
nature of the premises upon which it is based. If the
premises be contradictory, it is, of course, defective.
But if the premises are non-contradictory or self-evident,
then the certainty of geometric notions and
conclusions is valid. Another consideration of prime
importance in this connection is the <i>definition</i>. From
it all premises proceed. Hence, the definition is even
more important than the premise; for it is the persisting
determinant of all geometric conclusions while
the premise is dependent upon the limitations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
definition. The determinative character of the definition
has led to its apotheosis; but this, admittedly, has
been necessary in order to give stability and permanency
to the conclusions which followed. But in
spite of this it would appear that the certainty of
geometric conclusions is not a quality to be reckoned
as absolute or final.</p>

<p>With the same certainty that it can be said the
sum of the angles of the triangle is equal to two right
angles it may be asserted that that sum is also greater
or less than two right angles. Certainty which is
based upon the inherent congruity of definitions,
premises and propositions is an entirely different
matter from that certainty which arises out of the real,
abiding validity of a scheme of thought. But this
difference is not lessened by the fact that the latter
is dependent, in a measure, upon the correct systematization
of our spatial experiences by means of
methodical processes. Euclidean geometry, accordingly,
is not so certain in its applications as it is utilitarian;
but non-Euclidean geometry is even less certain
than the former and consequently more lacking in its
utilitarian possibilities.</p>

<p>The necessity of geometrical determinations is
merely the necessity which inheres in logical inferences
or deductions. These may or may not be valid.
Inasmuch as the necessariness of deductions is primarily
based upon the conditional certainty of premises and
definitions it appears that this quality is in no way
peculiar to geometry whether Euclidean or non-Euclidean.
In like manner, the universality of geometric
judgments may not properly be regarded as
a peculiarity of geometry; but is explicable upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
basis of the formal character of the assumptions
which underlie it. The chief value, then, of non-Euclidean
geometry seems to abide in the fact that
it clarifies our understanding as to the complex processes
by which it is possible to organize and systematize
our spatial experiences for assimilation and
use in other branches of knowledge.</p>

<p>With the above statement of the case of the
non-Euclidean geometry it is now thought permissible
to state briefly some of the elements thereof.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Below will be found some of the elements obtained
as a consequence of efforts made both at
proving and disproving the parallel-postulate of
Euclid:</p>

<p>"If two points determine a line it is called a
straight."</p>

<p>"If two straights make with a transversal equal
alternate angles they have a common perpendicular."</p>

<p>"A piece of a straight is called a sect."</p>

<p>"If two equal coplanar sects are erected perpendicular
to a straight, if they do not meet, then the
sect joining their extremities makes equal angles with
them and is bisected by a perpendicular erected midway
between their feet."</p>

<p>"The sum of the angles of a rectilineal triangle
is a straight angle, in the hypothesis of the right
(angle); is greater than a straight angle in the hypo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>thesis
of the obtuse (angle); is less than a straight
angle in the hypothesis of the acute (angle)."</p>

<p>"The hypothesis of right is Euclidean; the hypothesis
of the acute is <span class="smcap">Bolyai-Lobachevskian</span>; the
hypothesis of obtuse is <span class="smcap">Riemannian</span>."</p>

<p>"If one straight is parallel to a second the second
is parallel to the first."</p>

<p>"Parallels continually approach each other."</p>

<p>"The perpendiculars erected at the middle point
of the sides of a triangle are all parallel, if two are
parallel."</p>

<p>"If the foot of a perpendicular slides on a straight
its extremity describes a curve called an equidistant
curve, or an equidistantial."</p>

<p>"An equidistantial will slide on its trace."</p>

<p>"In the hypothesis of the obtuse a straight is of
finite size and returns into itself."</p>

<p>"Two straights always intersect."</p>

<p>"Two straights perpendicular to a third straight
intersect at a point half a straight from the third either
way."</p>

<p>"A pole is half a straight from its polar."</p>

<p>"A polar is the locus of coplanar points half a
straight from its pole. Therefore, if the pole of one
straight lies on another straight the pole of this second
straight is on the first straight."</p>

<p>"The cross of two straights is the pole of the join
of their poles."</p>

<p>"Any two straights inclose a plane figure, a digon."</p>

<p>"Two digons are congruent if their angles are
equal."</p>

<p>"The equidistantial is a circle with center at the
poles of its basal straight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>A typical postulate based upon the <span class="smcap">Bolyai</span> hypothesis
of the acute angle is the following:</p>

<p>"From any point <i>P</i> drop <i>PC</i>, a perpendicular to
any given straight line <i>AB</i>. If <i>D</i> move off indefinitely
on the ray <i>CB</i>, the sect will approach as limit <i>PF</i>
copunctal with <i>AB</i> at infinity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig05.jpg" alt=""></img><br />
   <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 5.</span>
</div>

<p><i>PD</i> is said to be at <i>P</i> the parallel to <i>AB</i> toward
<i>B</i>. <i>PF</i> makes with <i>PC</i> an angle <i>CPF</i> which is called
the angle of parallelism for the perpendicular <i>PC</i>.
It is less than a right angle by an amount which is
the limit of the deficiency of the triangle <i>PCD</i>. On
the other side of <i>PC</i>, an equal angle of parallelism
gives the parallel <i>P</i> to <i>BA</i> towards <i>AM</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Thus at
any point there are two parallels to a straight. A
straight has, therefore, two separate points at infinity."</p>

<p>"Straights through <i>P</i> which make with <i>PC</i> an angle
greater than the angle of parallelism and less than its
supplement do not meet the straight <i>AB</i> at all not
even at infinity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The parallel-postulate is stated in the non-Euclidean
geometry as follows:</p>

<p>"If a straight line meeting two straight lines make
those angles which are inward and upon the same side
of it less than two right angles the two straight lines
being produced indefinitely will meet each other on
this side where the angles are less than two right
angles."</p>

<p>It is stated by <span class="smcap">Manning</span><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in the following language:</p>

<p>"If two lines are cut by a third and the sum of
the interior angles on the same side of the cutting
line is less than two right angles the line will meet
on that side when sufficiently produced."</p>

<p>It is rather significant that in this postulate which
is really a definition of space should be found grounds
for such diverse interpretations as to its nature. Of
course, the moment the mind seeks to understand the
infinite by interpreting it in the unmodified terms of the
apparently unchangeable finite it entangles itself into
insurmountable difficulties. As a drowning man grasps
after straws so the mind, immersed in endless abysses
of infinity, fails to conduct itself in a seemly manner;
but gasps, struggles and flounders and is happy if it
can, in the depths of its perplexity, discover a way of
logical escape. The pure mathematician has a hankering
after the logically consistent in all his pursuits; to
him it is the "Holy Grail" of his highest aspirations.
He seeks it as the devotee seeks immortality. It is to
him a philosopher's stone, the elixir of perpetual youth,
the eternal criterion of all knowledge.</p>

<p>Failures to demonstrate the celebrated postulate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Euclid</span> led, as a matter of course, to the substitution
of various other postulates more or less equivalent to
it in that each of them may be deduced from the
other without the aid of any new hypothesis.</p>

<p>Among those who sought proof by a restatement
of the problem are the following:</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span>: The internal angles which two parallels
make with a transversal on the same side are
supplementary.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Clavius</span>: Two parallel straight lines are equidistant.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Proclus</span>: If a straight line intersects one of
two parallels it also intersects the other.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Wallis</span>: A triangle being given another triangle
can be constructed similar to the given one and
of any size whatever.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Bolyai (W.)</span>: Through three points not lying
on a straight line a sphere can always be drawn.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Lorenz</span>: Through a point between the lines
bounding an angle a straight line can always be drawn
which will intersect these two lines.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Saccheri</span>: The sum of the angles of a triangle
is equal to two right angles.</p>

<p>There were, of course, many other statements and
substitutions used by mathematicians in their endeavors
satisfactorily to establish the truth of the
parallel-postulate. That their labors should have
terminated, first, by doubting it, then by denying, and
finally, by building up a system of geometries which
altogether ignores the postulate is just what might
naturally be expected of these men who have given
to the world the non-Euclidean geometry. In doing
what they did many, if not all of them, were not aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
in any measure of the proportions of the imposing
superstructure that would be built upon their apparent
failures. All of them undoubtedly must have sensed
the vague adumbrations forecast by the unfolding mysteries
which they sought to lay bare; all of them must
have felt as they executed the early tasks of those
crepuscular days of pure mathematics that the way
which they were traveling would lead to the inner
shrine of a higher knowledge and a wider freedom;
they may have been led by divine intuition to strike
out on this new path and yet they could not have
known how fully their dreams would be realized by the
mathematicians of the twentieth century. If so, they
were truly gods and mathesis is their kingdom.</p>

<p>The analyst proceeds upon a basis entirely at variance
with that which guides the ordinary investigator
in the formulation of his conclusions. The empirical
scientist in arriving at his theories or hypotheses is
governed at all times by the degree of conformity
which his postulates exhibit to the actual phenomena
of nature. He endeavors to ascertain just how far
or in what degree his hypothesis is congruent with
things found in nature. If the dissidence is found to
predominate he abandons his theory and makes another
statement and again sets out to determine the degree
of conformity. If he then finds that the natural phenomena
agree with his theory he accepts it as for the
time being finally settling the question. In all things
he is limited by the answer which nature gives to his
queries. Not so with the exponent of pure mathematics.
For him the truth of hypotheses and postulates
is not dependent upon the fact that physical
nature contains phenomena which answer to them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
sole determining factor for him is whether or not he
is able to state with <i>rational consistency</i> the assumed
first principles and then logically develop their consequences.
If he can do this, that is, if he can state his
hypotheses with consistency and develop their consequences
into a logical system of thought, he is quite
satisfied and well pleased with his performances. But
the fact that this is true is of vital significance for all
who seek clearly to understand the essential character
of hyperspatiality.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that the science of consequences
is the radical essence of pure geometry. The
metageometrician enjoys unlimited freedom in the
choice of his postulates and suffers curtailment only
when it comes to the question of consistency. He is
at liberty to formulate as many systems of geometry as
the barriers of consistency will permit and these are
practically innumerable. So long then as the laws of
compatibility remain inviolate his multiplication of
postulate-systems may proceed indefinitely. Is it
strange then that under conditions where an investigator
has such unbridled liberty he should be found
indulging in mathetic excesses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kant</span> held that the axioms of geometry are synthetic
judgments <i>a priori</i>; but it appears that in the
strictest sense this is not the case. It depends upon
the type of mind which is taken as a standard of reference.
If it be the uncultivated mind, it is certain that
to it the relations expressed by an axiom would never
appear spontaneously. If on the other hand, the
standard be that of a cultivated mind it is also equally
certain that to it these relations would be discovered
only after methodical operations. All judgments ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>rived
at as a result of logical processes should, it seems,
be regarded as judgments <i>a posteriori</i>, i.e., the results
of empirical operations. Confessedly, the facts adduced
in course of experimentation serve as guides in
choosing among all of the many possible logical conventions;
but our choice remains untrammeled except by
the compulsion arising out of a fear of inconsistency.
The real criterion then of all geometries is neither
truth, conformability nor necessity, but consistency and
convenience.</p>

<p>The difficulty with the non-Euclideans resolved
itself into the question as to whether it is more consistent,
as well as convenient, to establish a proof of
the postulate by taking advantage of the support to
be found in other postulates or whether, by seeking a
demonstration based upon the deliveries of sense-experience
as to the nature of space and its properties,
a still more consistent conclusion might be reached.
They had further perplexity, however, when it came
to a decision as to whether the organic world is produced
and maintained in Euclidean space or in a purely
conceptual space which alone can be apprehended by
the mind's powers of representation. Unwilling to
admit the existence of the world in Euclidean space,
they turned their attention to the examination of the
properties of another kind of space so-called which
unlike the space of the Ionian school could be made to
answer not only all the purposes of plane and solid
figures, but of spherics as well. And so, the manifold
space was invented by <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> and later underwent
some remarkable improvements at the hands of his
disciple, <span class="smcap">Beltrami</span>. But it may be said here, parenthetically,
that the truth of the whole matter is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
our world is neither in Euclidean nor non-Euclidean
space, both of which, in the last analysis, are conceptual
abstractions. Although it may not be denied that
the Euclidean space is the more compatible.</p>

<p>The problem of devising a space, if only a very
limited portion, in which could be demonstrated the
assumed alternative hypothesis and its consequences
logically developed, occasioned no inconsiderable concern
for the non-Euclidean investigators; but neither
<span class="smcap">Lobachevski</span>, <span class="smcap">Bolyai</span> nor <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> were to be
baffled by the difficulties which they met. These only
cited them to more laborious toil. Having succeeded
in mentally constructing the particular kind of space
which was adaptable to their rigorous mathetic requirements
it immediately occurred to them that all the
qualities of the limited space thus devised might
logically be amplified and extended to the entire world
of space and that what is true of figures constructed
in the segmented portion of space which they used
for experimental purposes is also true of figures drawn
anywhere in the universe of this space as all lines
drawn in the finite, bounded portion could be extended
indefinitely and all magnitudes similarly treated. From
these results, it was but a single step to the conclusion
which followed&mdash;that either an entirely new world
of space had been discovered or that our notion of
the space in which the organic world was produced is
wholly wrong and needs revision. But notwithstanding
the insurmountable obstacles which stood in the
way of the investigators who made the attempt to
discover the homology which might exist between the
characteristics of the newly fabricated space and the
phenomenal world, investigations were carried for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ward
with almost amazing recklessness and loyalty to
the mathetic spirit until it was discovered that all efforts
to trace out any definite lines of correspondence were
futile. Then the policy of ignoring the question of
conformability was adopted and has since been pursued
with unchangeable regularity by the analytical
investigator.</p>

<p>Among the results obtained by the non-Euclideans
in their profound researches into the nature of hyperspace
are these: 1. It was found that the angular sum
of a triangle, being ordinarily assumed to be a variable
quantity, is either less or greater than two right angles
so that a strictly Euclidean rectangle could not be constructed.
2. The angle sums of two triangles of equal
area are equal. 3. No two triangles not equal can
have the same angles so that similar triangles are impossible
unless they are of the same size. 4. If two
equal perpendiculars are erected to the same line, their
distance apart increases with their length. 5. A line
every point of which is equally distant from a given
straight line is a curved line. 6. Any two lines which
do not meet, even at infinity, have one common perpendicular
which measures their minimum distance.
7. <i>Lines which meet at infinity are parallel.</i> But it is
apparent that these results have not followed upon any
mathematical consequence of other supporting postulates
or axioms such as would place them on a coördinate
basis with those used as a support for the parallel-postulate;
for they are based upon the envisagement of
an entirely new principle of space-perception and belong
to a wholly different set of space qualities.</p>

<p>The final issue then of the non-Euclidean geometry
is neither in the utility of its processes and conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
nor in the increscent inclination towards a new outlook
upon the world of mathesis; but resides solely in the
possibilities yet to be developed in that vast domain of
analytical thought which it has discovered and opened
to view. To say that it sheds any light upon the nature
of the universe is perhaps to take the radical view;
yet it cannot be doubted that the researches incident
to the formulation of the non-Euclidean geometry
have greatly extended the scope of consciousness.
Whether the extension is valid and normal or simply
a hypertrophic excrescence of mental feverishness;
whether by virtue of it we shall more closely approach
an understanding of the true nature of the mind of
the Infinite, or shall all fall into insanity, are certainly
debatable questions. It nevertheless appears evident
that humanity has gained something of real, abiding
permanence by this new departure. If that something
be merely an extended consciousness or an awakening
to the fact that there are stages of awareness beyond
the strictly sensuous, and every observable evidence
points to this, then there has only begun the process
by which the faculty of conscious functioning in this
new world shall become the normal possession of the
human species. But this new world cannot be said to
be of mathematical import; for it is doubtful if mathematical
laws such as have been devised up to the
present time, would obtain therein. So that if anything,
it must be psychological and vital.</p>

<p>On this view the worlds of hyperspace inlaid with
analytic manifoldnesses and constant curvatures are
but the primal excitants which will finally awaken in
the mind the faculty of awareness in the new domain
of psychological content. Then will come the bloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>ing
of the diurnal flower of the mind's immortality and
the outputting of the organ of consciousness wherewith
the infinite stretches of hyperspaces, the low-lying
valleys of reals and imaginaries and the uplifting
hills of finites and infinites shall be divested of their
mysteries and stand out in their unitariness no longer
draped in the veil of the inscrutable and the incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The fourth dimension, regarded by some as a new
scope of motion for objects in space, by others as a
new and strange direction of spatial extent and by
others still as the doorway of the temple of exegesis
wherein an explanation may be found for the entire
congeries of mysteries and supermysteries which now
perplex the human mind, may also be said to be
the key to the non-Euclidean geometry. But it really
complicates the situation; for one has to be capable of
prolonged abstract thought even to envisage is as a
conceptual possibility. <span class="smcap">Poincaré</span><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> says: "Any one
who should dedicate his life to it could, perhaps,
eventually imagine the fourth dimension," implying
thereby that a lifetime of prolonged abstract thought
is necessary to bring the mind to that point of ecstasy
where it could even so much as imagine this additional
dimension. Nevertheless by it (the fourth dimension)
was the non-Euclidean geometry made and without it
was not any of the hyperspaces made that were made.
It is the view which geometers have taken of space
in general that has made the fourth dimension possible,
and not only the fourth, but dimensions of all
degrees. The basis of the non-Euclidean geometry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
may be found then in the notion of space which has
been predominant in the minds of the investigators.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be pointed out that the non-Euclidean
geometry, though a consistent system of
postulates, has been constructed upon a misconception
based upon the identification of real, perceptual space
with systems of space-measurements. Hyperspaces
which are not spaces at all should not be confounded
with <i>real space</i>. But they constitute the substance of
non-Euclidean geometry; they are its blood and sinews.
Their study is interesting, because of the possibilities
of speculation which it offers. No mind that has
thought deeply upon the intricacies of the fourth dimension,
or hyperspace, remains the same after the
process. It is bound to experience a certain sense of
humility, and yet some pride born of a knowledge that
it has been in the presence of a great mystery and has
delved into the fearful deeps of kosmic mind. To the
mind that has thus been anointed by the sacred chrism
of the inner mysteries of creative mentality there
always come that stillness and calm such as characterize
the aftermath of reflection upon the incomprehensible
and the transfinite.</p>

<p>Arbitrary Character of Dimensionality&mdash;Various Definitions of
Dimension&mdash;Real Space and Geometric Space Differentiated&mdash;The
Finity of Space&mdash;Difference Between the
Purely Formal and the Actual&mdash;Space as Dynamic Appearance&mdash;The
<i>A Priori</i> and the <i>A Posteriori</i> as Defined by
<span class="smcap">Paul Carus</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p>In previous chapters we have traced the growth
and development of the non-Euclidean geometry showing
that the so-called fourth dimension is an aspect
thereof. It is now deemed fitting that we should
enter into a more detailed study of the question of
dimensionality with a view to examining some of the
difficulties which encompass it.</p>

<p>The question of dimension is as old as geometry
itself. Without it geometric conclusions are void and
meaningless. Yet the conception of dimensionality
itself is purely conventional. In its application to space
there is involved a great deal of confusion because of
the inferential character of its definition. For instance,
commonly we measure a body in space and arbitrarily
assign three elements to determine its position. The
simplest standard for this purpose is the cube having
three of its edges terminating at one of its corners.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig06.jpg" alt=""></img><br />
   <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 6.</span>
</div>

<p>Thus because it is found that the entire volume of
a cube is actually comprehended within the directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
indicated by the lines <i>ab</i>, <i>bc</i> and <i>db</i> it is determined
that the three coördinates of the point <i>b</i> are necessary
and sufficient to establish the dimensions of the cube
and consequently of the space in which it rests. The
conception may be stated in this way: If a collection
of elements, say points or lines, be of such a nature or
order that it is sufficient to know a certain definite number
of facts about it in order to be able to distinguish
every one of the elements from all the others, then
the assemblage or collection of elements is said to be
of the same number of dimensions as there are elements
necessary to its determination. In the above
figure there are three elements, namely, the lines <i>ab</i>,
<i>bc</i>, and <i>db</i>, which are necessary and sufficient for the
determination of the position of the point <i>b</i>. In this
way geometers have determined that our space is tridimensional;
but it is obvious that this conclusion is
based not upon any examination of space itself but
upon the measurement of bodies in space. Upon this
view it is seen that conclusions based upon such a procedure
render our notion of the extension of bodies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
space identical with the notion of spatial extensity. In
other words, we take bodies in space and by examining
their characteristics and properties arrive at an alleged
apodeictic judgment of space. It is by means
of this conventional norm of geometric knowledge that
various other spaces, notably the one-, two-, four-and
<i>n</i>-space, have been devised. It would appear that if
some more absolute standard of measurement or definition
of space were adopted the confusion which now
clings to the conception of dimension could be obviated.
For if it be true that three and only three elements are
necessary to determine a point-position in our space
and that in this determination we also find the number
of dimensions of space, then it may also be true that
<i>n</i>-coördinates would just as truly determine the dimensionality
of an <i>n</i>-space, which is granted. But then
the <i>n</i>-space would be just as legitimate as the three-space;
for it is determined by exactly the same standards.
It is both quantitatively and qualitatively the
same. If, however, on account of the exigencies that
might arise, we are forced to seek solace in the notion
of an <i>n</i>-space whither shall we turn for it? It cannot
be found; for it is imperceptible, uninhabitable, non-existent,
and therefore, absolutely and purely an abstraction.
Consequently, there must be something
radically wrong with the definition of space or with
its determinants.</p>

<p>The purely arbitrary character of dimensionality is
very aptly described by <span class="smcap">Cassius Jackson Keyser</span>,
who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... The dimensionality of a given space is
not unique, but depends upon the choice of the
geometric entity for primary or generating element.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
A space being given, its dimensionality is not therewith
determined, but depends upon the will of the
investigator who by a proper choice of generating
element endows the space with any dimensionality
he pleases. That fact is of cardinal significance for
science and philosophy."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is a fact of "cardinal significance" for science;
because it emphasizes the necessity for some more
rational procedure than that of the geometrician in arriving
at an absolutely unique method of determining
the dimension and essential nature of real space. Its
significance for philosophy lies in the need of a logical,
rigidly exclusive and absolutely peculiar standard of
space definition. The definition of perceptual space
should be such as rigorously inhibits its inclusion as a
particular in any general class. The necessity for this
is warranted by its universality and uniqueness.</p>

<p>The lines of demarkation between what is recognized
as perceptual space and what has been called
geometric or conceptual space should be very sharply
drawn. So that when reference is made to either there
will be no doubt as to which is meant. And then, too,
conceptual space is no space at all, properly speaking.
It is merely a system of space-measurement. And as
such has no logical right to be put in the same category
as perceptual space.</p>

<p>Real space is unique. Geometric space belongs to
a class whose members are capable of indefinite multiplication.
It is certainly most illogical to identify
them. Perceptual space, figuratively speaking, is a
quantity; analytic space is the foot-rule, the yard-stick,
the kilometer, by which it is measured and apportioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
It is logically impossible to predicate the same conclusion
for both of them. That is, to do so causes a
profound fracture of the fundamental norms of logic.
Such conclusions being thus illegitimate it is rather surprising
that an error of this nature should have been
made. It is perhaps accountable for on the grounds of
the geometer's complete <i>insouciance</i> as to how his
postulates shall stand in their relation to things in the
phenomenal world.</p>

<p>It is agreed that as convenient as is Euclid's system
of space-measurement it is not by any means congruent
with the extension of real space objects. It
does, however, approximate congruity with these objects
as nearly as possible. How then could it be expected
that a system of space-measurement so far
removed from this primary congruence as the non-Euclidean
system is should exhibit more obvious signs
of correspondence? But the advocates of the <i>n</i>-dimensionality
of space have illatively asserted the identity
of space and its dimensions. Accordingly, there is not
recognized any distinction between their conception of
space itself and its qualitative peculiarities. They use
the terms interchangeably. So that dimension means
space and <i>vice versa</i>. In this lack of discrimination
may be found the source of much of the confusion
which attaches to the conception of space.</p>

<p>If it were arguable that the relation between space
and its dimensions is the same as that between matter
and its properties then the restriction of this relation to
three and only three directions of extent would be disallowed;
for the reason that if, as is commonly done,
dimension be made to mean direction of extent, there
would be an unlimited number of directions of extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and they would all be perceptible. But this is really
another fundamental fault. Non-Euclideans have
stretched the meaning of the term dimension so that
it not only includes the idea of direction but an entirely
new class of qualities&mdash;the fourth dimension. And
despite this reformation of the original conception,
they demand that it shall be called space.</p>

<p>We have just shown that the generic concept of
dimensionality is that three and only three coördinates
are necessary and sufficient for its determination.
Granting that this is true, are we not compelled consequently
to see that we have, by adding a fourth or
<i>n</i>-dimensions, involved ourselves into a more complex
situation than before? For by postulating a fourth
dimension either we have created a new world whose
dimensions are four in number or we have explicitly
admitted that the three dimensions have a fourth.
Aside from the logical difficulties which beset these conclusions
there is also set up a condition which is at
variance with the most elementary requirements of
common sense.</p>

<p>Thus far mathematical thought has not served to
clarify our notions of space nor to shed any new light
upon the vital processes which are alleged to have
their explanation in the new discovery. Simply stated,
metageometricians have brought us to the place where
we must either recognize that the fourth dimension is
another sphere lying dangerously near the earth in
which space extends in four primary directions and in
which four coördinates are necessary for its determination
or we are driven to the other horn of the dilemma
where we are brought face to face with the conclusion
that the three perceptual space dimensions have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
common a hitherto unknown property or extension in
virtue of which it may be viewed as having an unlimited
number of dimensions. To accept the latter
view is equivalent to saying that, in the above figure,
the three lines <i>ab</i>, <i>bc</i> and <i>db</i> have formed a triple
<i>entente</i> by which they have mutually and severally acquired
a new domain, hyperspace, and in which, because
of the vast resources of the region, they are able
to perform wondrous things.</p>

<p>Let us examine briefly the various current definitions
of dimension. It is assumed by not a few that
dimension is the same as <i>direction</i>. But can we grant
this wholly to be true? If so, then a mere child may
see that there are and must necessarily be as many
dimensions as there are directions. Primarily, there are
six directions of space and an unlimited number of
subsidiary directions. On this view it is not necessary
to invent a new domain of space if the object be
merely to discover and utilize a greater number of
dimensions than has heretofore been allowed. For
the identification of the term dimension with direction
already makes available an almost infinite number of
dimensions. But this view is objected to by the advocates,
for it is contrary to the hypothesis of <i>n</i>-dimensionality.</p>

<p>Dimension also means <i>extent</i>. This is partially
true. It cannot be wholly true. For, if it were, then,
space would have only one dimension which is also not
allowable under the hypothesis. Then the definition
leaves out of account the idea that space is at the same
time a direction or collection of directions. The term
extension is generic and when applied to space means
extension in all possible directions and not in any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
direction. So that it is not permissible to say that
space extends in this direction or that because it extends
in all directions simultaneously and equally.</p>

<p>Geometers claim that space is a system of coördinates
necessary for the establishment of a point-position
in it. This view, however, identifies space with
a system of space-measurement and is therefore faulty.
According to this view there may be as many spaces
as there are systems of space-measurement and the
latter may be limitless. But if the totality of spaces
are to be viewed as one space then we shall have one
space with an indefinite number of dimensions; also an
indefinite number of space measurements which would
be confusing. Much, if not all, of such a system's
utility and convenience would be unavailable or useless.
That, too, would be in violation of the avowed
purpose of these investigations which is to enhance the
utility and convenience of mathematic operations.</p>

<p>Now it is evident that space is neither direction,
extension, a system of space-measurement nor a system
of manifolds whose dimensions are generable. And
this is so for the same reason that a piece of cloth
is not the elements of measurement&mdash;inches, feet,
yards&mdash;by which it is apportioned. And because we
find that the fabric of space lends itself accommodatingly
to our conventional norms of measurement is
not sufficient reason for identifying it with these norms.
Here we have the source of all error in mathematical
conclusions about the nature of space; because all such
conclusions are based not upon the intrinsic nature of
space, but upon artificial forms which we choose to
impose upon it for our own convenience. But it should
be remembered that the irregularities which we note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
are not in space itself but inhere in the forms which we
use. For these purposes space is extremely elastic and
accommodates itself to the shape and scope of any
construction we may decide to try upon it. In this
respect it is like water which has no regard for the
shape, size or kind of vessel into which it may be
posited. There is one thing certain that judging from
the above considerations there has been not yet any
absolute, all-satisfying definition devised for space by
mathematicians.</p>

<p>The best definitions hitherto constructed are purely
artificial and arbitrary determinations. It is rather
anomalous that there should be so little unanimity
about what is the most fundamental consideration of
mathematical conclusions which are supposed to be so
certain, so necessary and universal as to be incontrovertible.
Confessedly, it is a condition which raises
again the question as to just what are the limits of
mathematical certainty and necessity and just how far
we shall depend upon the validity of mathematics to
determine for us absolutely certain conclusions about
the nature of space. In view of the uncertainty noted,
are we justified in following too closely the mathematic
lead even in matters of logic, to say nothing of our
conception of space? It seems that we shall have
necessarily, on account of the recognized limitations of
mathematics in this matter, to turn to some more
tenable source for the norms of our knowledge concerning
space. For in the light of the rather indefensible
position which metageometricians have involved
themselves there appears to be no hope in this
direction.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly safer not to rely altogether upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the purely abstract, even in the world of mathesis,
for any absolute criterion of knowledge. It is perhaps
well that we should expunge the word <i>absolute</i>
from our vocabularies. It is really a misnomer and
has no meaning in the lexicon of nature. There is in
reality no <i>absolute</i> in the sense of final absolution from
all conditions or restrictions.</p>

<p>In the ultimate analysis there is unquestionably no
hue, tone, quality, condition nor any imaginable posture
of life, being or manifestation that is absolved
from every other one of its class or from the totality.
All these are relational and interdependent. There
is no room for the absolute. In fact, it is a quality
which cannot in any way be ascribed to any aspect of
kosmic manifestation. It has existence only in the
mind and has been devised for the purpose of marking
the limits of its scope. All being is relative; all
life is relative and is destined to change its qualities
as it evolves. All knowledge is also relative and what
is true of one state may not be true of another; what
is true of one life may not be true of another life;
the limitations of one degree of knowledge may not
have any bearings upon another degree. The norms
of one will not satisfy the conditions of another stage
of manifestation. It is always within limits that the
criterion of knowledge will be found to satisfy a given
set of conditions. Hence within certain limits mathematical
conclusions will maintain their validity. Error
is committed by pushing the validity of these limits to
a position without the sphere of limitations. This
seems to be the crux of the whole matter. Mathematicians,
notably non-Euclideans, have sought to extend
the comparatively small sphere of limits of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>gruence
between mathematic and perceptual space to
such an extent as to cause it to encroach upon forbidden
territory. In doing this they have erred grievously,
causing serious offense to the more sensitive spirit of
the high-caste mathematicians among whom are
none more truly conservative than <span class="smcap">Paul Carus</span>,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Metageometricians are a hot-headed race and
display sometimes all the characteristics of sectarian
fanatics. To them it is quite clear there may be two
straight lines through one and the same point which
do not coincide and yet are both parallel to a third
line."</p></blockquote>

<p>To the student who has carefully followed the development
of the non-Euclidean geometry and the
notion of hyperspace the above characterization is
none too severe nor ill-deserved. Nothing could more
vividly yet correctly portray the impious tactics of the
metageometrician and establish his perceptual obliquity
more surely than the mere fact, mentioned by
<span class="smcap">Carus</span>, that he can with evident lack of mental perturbation
proclaim that two straight lines, noncoincident
with each other, may pass through a point and
yet be parallel to a third line. But this is a mere trifle,
a bagatelle, to the many other infractions of which
he is guilty. The wonder is that he is able to secure
such obsequious acceptance of his offerings as many of
the most serious minded mathematicians are inclined
to give. Is it to be wondered at that, despite the
profuse protestations of the advocates, many who
take up the study of the question of hyperspace should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
experience a deep revulsion from the posture assumed
by metageometricians with respect to these queries?</p>

<p>Linked with the idea of dimensionality is the
notion that space is infinite. This is a conception which
has its roots imbedded in the depths of antiquity.
Primitive man, looking up into the heavens at what
appeared to him as a never ending extension, was
awed by its vastness; but the minds of the most
learned of the present-day men are not free from this
innate dread of infinity. It permeates the thought life
of all alike and none seems to be able to rise above it.
Mathematicians, philosophers, scientists all share in
the general belief that space is without limit, unending
in extent and eternally existent. <span class="smcap">Riemann</span>, whose
thought life found its most convenient mode of expression
by means of pure mathematics, was the first in the
history of human thought to surmise that space is not
infinite but limited even though unbounded. But his
conception has been much vitiated on account of its
entanglement with an <i>idealized</i> construction by which
space is regarded as a thing to be manipulated and
generated by act of thought. Were it not for this his
conception would indeed mark the beginning of a new
era in psychogenesis. As it is, when all the nonsensical
effusions have been cleared away from our space conceptions
and men come really to understand something
of the essential nature of space this new era will find
its true beginnings in the mind of <span class="smcap">Riemann</span>. Although
it must be said, as is the case with all progressive
movements, the later development of a rationale for
this conclusion will vary greatly from his original conception.
For he had in mind a space that is generable
and therefore a logical construction while ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the mind will swing back to a consideration of real
space.</p>

<p>Already men are beginning to see a new light.
Already they are beginning to take a new view of space
in general. The departure is especially noticeable
in the attitude assumed by <span class="smcap">Hiram M. Stanley</span>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If we seek the most satisfactory understanding
of space we shall look neither to mathematics
nor Psychology but to Physics. The trend of
Physics, say with such a representative as <span class="smcap">Ostwald</span>,
is to make things the expression of force; the constitution
and appearance of things are determined
by dynamism; and we may best interpret space as a
mode of this dynamic appearance."</p></blockquote>

<p>Space, as a mode of dynamic appearance is a slight
improvement upon the old idea of a pure vacuity; for
in the light of what we now know about space content
much of the dignity of that view has been lost.
Men now know that space is not an empty void. They
know that the atmosphere fills a great deal of space.
They also have extended their conception in this direction
to include the ether and occultism goes further and
postulates four kinds of ether&mdash;the chemical, life, light
and psychographic ethers. But it does not stop here.
It postulates a series of grades of finer matter than
the physical which fills space and permeates its entire
extent even to identification with its essential nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stanley</span> continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Everything does not, as commonly conceived,
fall into some pre-existent space convenient for it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
but everything makes its own spaciousness by its own
defensive and offensive force, and the totality of all
appearance is space in general."</p></blockquote>

<p>According to <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, not only do physical, perceptual
objects, by their "offensive and defensive
force" make their own space but the appearance of
that in which no physical object is makes room for
itself by its own dynamic force. In other words, that
which we call "pure extensity" is by virtue of its
dynamism the cause of its own existence.</p>

<p>At first hand there appears to be little worthy of
serious consideration in this view of <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>; yet,
if carried to its logical conclusion, the merit of the
hypothesis becomes apparent. Accordingly, interstellar
distances which are commonly said to be even
without air or life of any kind are really an appearance
possessed of a dynamism peculiar to itself. And this
very force-appearance, constituting space, is that which
makes it perceivable. For instance, let us say the space
that exists between the earth and the moon, is not
really empty nor does it have an existence prior to itself,
but is a mode of dynamic appearance which is the cause
of its own existence. Its dynamic character makes it to
appear perceptible to our senses. Logically, if the
dynamism were removed there would remain neither
space nor the appearance of space. If this were true,
and it is worthy of serious thought, then space is certainly
finite, as in its totality, according to <span class="smcap">Stanley's</span>
view, it would have to be regarded as a "phenomenon
of the inner and finite life of the infinite."</p>

<p>It is believed that we may go a step further and
unqualifiedly assert that <i>space is finite</i>, even denying
its infinity as a "general mode of the activity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
whole." Yet it is transfinite in the sense that it transcends
the comprehension of finite minds or processes.
It is <i>finite</i> because it is in <i>manifestation</i>. Everything
that is in manifestation is finite. The infinite is not in
manifestation. Infinity has to be limited always to
become manifest. The Deity has limited His being in
order that there may be a manifested universe. All
things, all appearances are finite; because they are
phenomena connected with manifestation.</p>

<p>This question may be viewed from another standpoint.
All things in manifestation or existence are
polar in their constitution. For instance: there cannot
be a "here" without a "there." There cannot be an
"upper" without a "lower." Right is copolar with
wrong; good is copolar with evil; night with day;
manifestation with non-manifestation; truth with
falsity; infinity with finity and so on, throughout the
whole gamut of the pairs of opposites. What is the
logical inference? Space is paired with a lack of
space. There cannot be what we call <i>space</i> without
there being at the same time the possibility, at least,
of the <i>lack of space or spacelessness</i>. This is a conclusion
that is rigorously logical and incontrovertible.</p>

<p>But it has been urged that it is impossible for the
mind to imagine a condition where there is no space.
It even has been asserted that it is contrary to the
constitution of the mind itself to imagine "no space."
But whether imaginable or not has no effect whatever
upon the validity of the conception. Neither, it is said,
can we imagine a fourth dimension but the mind has
come dangerously near to imagining it. The distance
from excogitating upon, discussing and describing the
properties of four-space to imagining it is not so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
after all. Truly it is difficult indeed, it seems, to be
able to describe a thing yet not be able to imagine or
make a mental image of it. There is an evident fallacy
here. Either the description of four-space is no description
at all or it is a true delineation of an idealized
construction which is well within the mind's powers of
imagination. Indeed the question of imaginability is
not determinative in itself; for what the mind may now
be unable to imagine, because of its more or less
nebulous character, and owing to its infancy may in
the course of time be easily accomplished.</p>

<p>The universe is a compacted <i>plenum</i>. It is chock-full
of mind, of life, of energy and matter. These
four are basically one. They exist, of course, in varying
degrees of tenuity and intensity and answer to a
wide range of vibrations. Together, in their manifestation
of action and interaction, in their <i>dynamic
appearance</i>, if you please, they constitute space. If these
were removed with all that their existence implies there
would result a condition of spacelessness in which no
one of the appearances which we now perceive would
be possible. Even sheer extensity would be non-existent.
All scope of motility would be lacking. Dimension,
coördinates, direction, space-relations&mdash;all
would be impossible.</p>

<p>A straight line is an ideal construction of the mind.
It does not exist in nature. It can never be actualized
in the phenomenal universe. Between the ideal and
the real, or actual, there is a kosmic chasm. It
broadens or narrows according as the phenomenal appearance
approaches or recedes from the ideal. What,
therefore, can be postulated of the one will not apply
with equal force to the other. They are not congru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ent
and can never be in the actualized universe. The
moment the actual becomes identified with the ideal
it ceases to be the actual. The universe does not exist
as <i>pure form</i>, neither does space. As purely formal
constructions of the intellect these can have no perceptible
existence. The phenomenal or sensible may
not be judged by exactly the same standard as the
formal. The phenomenal or sensible represents things
as they appear to the senses, or, so far as the actualized
universe is concerned, <i>as they really are</i>. The <i>formal</i>
represents things as they are made to appear by the
mind. It cannot be actualized. It may be said that
the purely formal is the limit of evolution. The phenomenal
may approach the ideal as a limit, but can
never become fully congruent with it. <i>The difference
between the ideal and the actual is a dynamic one</i>;
it is by virtue of this difference that the universe is
held in manifestation. Evolution is the decrement of
this difference between the purely formal and the
actual. So long then as a kosmic differential is maintained
the phenomenal continues to be manifest: when
it is finally reduced to nothing it goes out of manifestation.
The phenomenal is finite; the ideal infinite.</p>

<p>Wherefore, it is undoubtedly improper to refer to
space as being infinite. The term really is inapplicable.
Transfinity is much better and more accurate.
Space is transfinite because its scope is greater than
any finite scope of motility can encompass, because it
exceeds finite comprehensibility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riemann's</span> notion that space is limited gains
weight in the light of the foregoing considerations.
But he could not conceive of the limitability and unboundedness
of space as such in its pure essence; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
was compelled, by his own limitations, to make an
idealized construction in which he could actualize
his conception. And for real, dynamic space, he substituted
his ideal construction and proceeded upon that
basis. And of course, his view while it had no reference
to perceptual space nevertheless possessed an
illative relation thereto and should be recognized as
construable in that light.</p>

<p>The process of squaring the circle recognized as a
geometric impossibility is significant of the fluxional
nature of the universal residuum perpetually maintained
between the archetypal and the manifested kosmos. It
seems that there is a profound truth embodied in this
problem. There is a lesson that may be learned by
mathematicians, philosophers, scientists and thinkers in
general. There is an element of eternal necessity and
universality about it which is truly symbolic of the
finity of the universe and the infinity of the archetypal.
Just as a square or a series of polygonal figures inscribed
in a circle cannot be made to coincide exactly
with the circle so cannot the actual be made to coincide
with the ideal. The circumference of the circle is
the unapproachable limit of inscribed squares. If it
were possible so to multiply squares thus inscribed
that a figure coincident with the circumference of a
circle might be constructed, such a figure would not be
a square but a circle. The manifested universe is like
that&mdash;the process of inscribing squares within a circle.
It is ever <i>becoming</i>, <i>evolving</i>, <i>developing</i>, but never
quite attains. Infinity is a process. But no single
stage in that process is infinite. Each is finite and their
totality makes the infinity of the process. The universe
manifested to the senses or the intellect is finite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Space," says <span class="smcap">Paul Carus</span>, "is the possibility
of motion in all directions."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> To be sure, it is admitted
that space offers opportunity for motion in all
directions. But is space this opportunity of motility?
Or is possibility of motion space? The possibility of
motion must rest in the thing that moves. It implies
a potency in the moving entity, not in space. If it is
meant that space is the potency that resides in the moving
element it is still more difficult to understand the
connotation. But even granting this view, are we
not compelled to recognize the dynamism of space
as a necessary inference? Another definition which
<span class="smcap">Carus</span> gives is that space is a "<i>pure form of extension</i>."
If it be granted that space is a pure form of
extension we should have to conclude that it has no
actual existence; for <i>pure form</i> does not exist except
as an idealized construction. It cannot be found in
nature. Pure form is <i>ideal</i>. Impure or natural form
is actual. Therefore the space in which we live and
in which the universe exists cannot be a "pure form"
because life cannot exist in the purely formal. It is
useless to talk about space as mere form so long as
it maintains life. The difficulty which this phase of the
question presents is another evidence of the inadequacy
of our definitions.</p>

<p>It is also found to be impossible to concur in
<span class="smcap">Carus'</span> conception of knowledge <i>a priori</i>. His notion
of the <i>a priori</i> varies somewhat from the Kantian view.
He defines it as an "idealized construction," the "mind
made," "abstract thought," and places it in the same
category as a concept. This is undoubtedly born of
his desire to get rid of <span class="smcap">Kant's</span> "innate ideas" which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
seem to be distasteful to him. But in doing so it
appears that the real <i>a priori</i> has been overlooked.
Let us examine for a moment this important question.
The <i>a posteriori</i> connotates all knowledge gained
through the senses, or sense experience. All knowledge
therefore whose origin can be traced to the senses
is knowledge <i>a posteriori</i>. Now, knowledge <i>a priori</i>
should be just the opposite of this. It should indicate
such knowledge as that which does not have its origin
in the senses, or which is not dependent upon the ordinary
avenues of sense-experience. Abstract thought is
as truly experience as smelling, seeing or hearing. It
is by traversing its scope of motility that the mind finds
out what the norms of logic are. It could not remain
quiescent and discover them. It has to be active, examining,
comparing and judging. Almost the entire
range of thought, its entire scope, is characterized by
the <i>a posterioristic method</i>. In fact, all thought is
<i>a posterioristic</i>. Despite the fact that, in thinking in
the abstract, it is necessary mentally to remove all elements
of concreteness, all materiality and all actuality,
the conclusions reached have to be referred to the
standards maintained by the actual, the concrete and
the material. Then we do not start with the abstract
in our thinking. We begin with the concrete and by
mentally removing all physical qualities arrive at the
abstract.</p>

<p>The mind has a constitution. It acts in a given
way because it is its nature so to act. Not because
it has learned to act in that manner. It performs
certain functions intuitively without previous instruction
or experience for the same reason that water
dampens or heat warms. It is natural for it to do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
This naturalness, this performance of function without
being taught or without experience constitute the
principle of <i>apriority</i> in the mind. <i>Aprioriness</i> is a
principle of mind partaking of the very nature and
essence of mind. It is the very mainspring of mentality.
Perception and conception are processes which
the mind performs intuitively. The mind perceives
and conceives because it is impossible for the normal
mind to do otherwise. We take a view upon a given
question; we assume certain mental attitudes of
affirmation, negation or indifference because we have
learned to do so by virtue of the tuitional capability
of mind. These describe the <i>a posteriori</i>. That is,
all knowledge obtained as a result of voluntary mental
processes constitutes the mass of knowledge <i>a posteriori</i>.
The <i>a priori</i> is what the mind is by nature:
the <i>a posteriori</i> is what the mind becomes. It is the
mind-content.</p>

<p>The <i>a priori</i> is not a mental construction; it is an
essential principle of mind. It should not be identified
with the "purely formal," as is done by <span class="smcap">Paul
Carus</span>:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The <i>a priori</i> is identical with the purely formal
which originates in our mind by abstraction. When
we limit our attention to the purely relational, dropping
all other features out of sight, we produce a
field of abstraction in which we can construct purely
formal combination, such as numbers, or the ideas
of types and species. Thus we create a world of
pure thought which has the advantage of being applicable
to any purely formal consideration and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
work out systems of numbers which, when counting,
we can use as standards of reference for our
experience in practical life."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus <span class="smcap">Carus</span> definitely links up the <i>a priori</i> to a
factor which is nothing more nor less than a mental
by-product. For such is the category in which would
be placed both the process of abstraction and its results.
It is therefore exceedingly difficult to understand
why so cursory a consideration should have been
given to the principle of <i>apriority</i> than which no other
element of mind is more essentially a part of the mind
itself.</p>

<p>The formal is symbolic. It signifies an informing
quantity. Pure form itself is but a negation of that
which formerly filled it. Then, too, the formal is
purely artificial because it is a mental construction.
Essentially there is as much difference between the
purely formal and the <i>a priori</i> as between creator and
creature, as between potter and clay. The one is the
builder, the other is the material; the one the knower
and the other the known. Thus, the only reason that
the formal is found to be answerable to the <i>a priori</i>
at all is due to the fact that it is construable only upon
the basis of the <i>a priori</i>. But being so is not sufficient
warrant for its identification with the <i>a priori</i>. The
formal merely represents the totality of possibilities
in the universe as viewed by the mind; but as the
number of possibilities open to the mind is, on account
of its nature and purpose limited, it is not to be supposed
that it (the mind) shall measure up to all the
possibilities offered by the formal. Moreover, it is
certain that no sane mind cherishes the hope that there
shall ever be found in the universe of life and form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
congruence for all of the possibilities held out by the
purely formal.</p>

<p>As an eternal principle of mind, the <i>a priori</i> is in
agreement with the divine mind of the kosmos. In its
<i>aposteriority</i> the mind is of diverse tendences, qualities
and characteristics. Apriorily, it acts in unison with
the eternal purpose of life and the universal mind.
In its aposteriority, it often goes awry. In its <i>apriority</i>
it can never be insane; insanity is a symptom of the
morbid <i>a posteriori</i>.</p>

<p>The mind in man acts the same as mind in the
vegetal and lower animal kingdoms. Metabolism and
katabolism, indeed all cell-activity, are <i>a priori</i> performances
of the mind. Growth and all its phenomena,
the cyclicism of natural processes, and every
activity connected therewith belong to the category of
the <i>a priori</i>. Cells multiply, divide, build up and tear
down tissues and they do it intuitively. Most certainly
these functions are performed without any assistance
from the intellect. All the myriad activities
in nature with which the intellect in man has not the
slightest concern, truly acting in accord with some
primordial impetus, are activities <i>a priori</i>.</p>

<p>Now what is the attitude of the intellect, in the
light of the <i>a priori</i>, towards space and the question
of dimensionality? It is evident that no matter what
this attitude may be it is in agreement with the constitution
of things and of the universe. And if so, it
is right and without illusion. It is also evident that
whatever notion <i>a posteriori</i> the intellect may entertain
with respect to these questions is unavoidably
liable to the illusionary drawbacks common to conclusions
based upon limited experience. The geometric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
view of space belongs to the category of the <i>a posteriori</i>.
Hence it is subject to the usual imposition of
error.</p>

<p>Tersely stated, <span class="smcap">Kant</span>'s view of space is that it is
a form of intuition, a form <i>a priori</i>, a transcendental
form. As such he considered it to be a native form of
perception not belonging to the category of sense-deliveries.
Accordingly, space is a form of intuition
arising out of and inhering in the constitution of mind.
It is a notion which constitutes the universal and
eternal prerequisite of mind and is, therefore, intrinsically
necessary to all phases of mentation. Now,
this being true just what may be said to be the relation
of dimensionality to this <i>a priori</i> form of space which
is found to exist in the mind as an eternal aspect of
its nature? Does the mind intuitively measure its contents
or its operations by the empirical standard of
space-measurement known as dimension? Is the attitude
of the mind towards the objectively real one of discrimination
<i>a priori</i> as to the direction or dimension in
which a percept may originate? In other words, does
the mind habitually and intuitively refer its data to a
system of coördinates for final determination? There
is no other answer but that the mind makes no such
reference and is dependent upon no kind of coördinate
system in any of its operations <i>a priori</i>. As a form
of intuition, the space notion is present in the mind
as a scope of existence, of motility, of being and of
sheer roominess. The notion of direction or dimension,
being an artificial construction, does not enter into
this form of intuition at all. It is only when the mind
comes to elaborate upon its perceptive performances
and possibilities that the questions of relations, posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>tions
and directions arise. But this latter is a matter
separate and distinct from the state of awareness
which embodies the notion of space.</p>

<p>Dimension is an arbitrary norm constructed by the
mind for the determination of various positions in
space. It is an accident or by-product of the process
of elaborative cognition, a convenient and appropriate
means of measurement for objects in space and their
space-relations. But it is no more <i>a priori</i> than a foot
rule or a square. But being purely an empirical product
it may be said to be an aspect of psychogenesis because
it relates to the evolutionary aspect of mind. The
assumption may therefore be allowed that the mind
may, in the course of its evolution, find it convenient
and appropriate to devise an additional ordinate or
dimension to satisfy the necessities of its more complex
ramifications into the nature of things and to determine
their greatly increased space-relations. It may
be even possible for the mind to function normally in
a space of four dimensions. But this would simply
be a new adjustment, not a change in the essential
nature of mind. It would be like the series of adjustments
to environments which man has made in the onward
movement of civilization. There has been no
serious change in the manhood <i>per se</i> of man. That
has remained the same; there has been merely a complication
of environmental influences. Similarly, in the
acquisition of four-dimensional powers, granting that
such an acquisition is possible, there is nothing to be
added to the <i>aprioriness</i> of mind <i>itself</i>. Is it not,
therefore, logical to assume that the discovery of a
fourth coördinate and the consequent conceptualization
of the same, point to the development in the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
of a greatly extended faculty, more keenly penetrative
powers of cognition and a further diversification of its
environments than it has hitherto enjoyed? Indeed,
it seems so.</p>

<p>The world of mathesis is truly a marvelous domain.
Vast are its possibilities and vaster still its
sweep of conceivability. It is the kingdom of the
mind where, in regal freedom, it may perform feats
which it is impossible to actualize in the phenomenal
universe. In fact, there is no necessity to consider the
limitations imposed by the actualities of the sensuous
world. Logic is the architect of this region, and for
it there is no limit to the admissibility of hypotheses.
These may be multiplied at will, and legitimately so.
The chief error lies in the attempt to make them
appear as actual facts of the physical world.</p>

<p>Mathematicians, speculating upon the possibilities
of mathetic constructions and forgetting the necessary
distinctions which should be recognized as differentiating
the two worlds, in their enthusiasm have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
led into the error of postulating as qualities of the
phenomenal world the characteristics of the conceptual.
Accordingly, a great deal of confusion as to the proper
limits and restrictions of these conceptions has arisen
and there still may be found those who are enthusiastically
endeavoring to push the actualities of the
physical over into the conceptual. But in assuming
any attitude towards mathetic propositions, especially
with a view to demonstrating their actuality, very careful
discrimination as to the essential qualities and their
connotations should be made. Hence, before taking
up a brief study of the fourth dimension proper, it is
deemed fitting to indicate some of the fundamental distinctions
which every student of these questions should
be able to make with reference to the data which he
meets.</p>

<p>All objects of the sensible world have both an essential
or ideal nature and a representative or sensuous
nature. That is, they may be studied from the standpoint
of the ideal as well as the sensuous. The representative
nature is that which we recognize as the mode
of appearance to our senses which, as <span class="smcap">Kant</span> held, is
not the essential or ideal character of the thing itself.
For there is quite as much difference between the sensuous
percept and the real thing itself as between an
object and its shadow. In fact, a concept viewed in
this light, may be seen to have all the characteristics
of an ordinary shadow; for instance, the shadow of a
tree. View it as the sun is rising; it will then be
seen to appear very much elongated, becoming less in
length and more distinct in outline as the sun rises to
a position directly overhead. The elongation may
again be seen when the sun is setting. Throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
day as the sun assumes different angles with reference
to the tree the proportions and definiteness of the
shadow vary accordingly. Thus the angularity of the
sun, the intensity and fullness of the light and the shape
and size of the tree operate to determine the character
of the shadow.</p>

<p>Much the same thing is true of a sensuous representation.
If we examine carefully our ideas of geometric
quantities and magnitudes, it will be found that
the concepts themselves are not identical with the
objects of the physical world, but mere mental shadows
of them. The angularity of consciousness, or the distinctness
of one's state of awareness, being analogous
to similar attitudes in the solar influence are the main
determinants of the character of the mental shadow
or concept. Wherefore mathematical "spaces" or
magnitudes are not sensuous things and have therefore
no more real existence than a shadow, and
strictly speaking not as much; for a shadow may be
seen, while such magnitudes can only be conceived. It
may be urged that since we can conceive of such things
they must have existence of some kind. And so they
have, but it is an existence of a different kind from that
which we recognize as belonging to things in the sensible
world. They have a conceptual existence, but not
a sensuous one. Therein lies the great difference.</p>

<p>To be sure, a shadow is a more or less true representation
of the thing to which it pertains. That
this is true can be established empirically. Similarly,
the degree of congruity between objects and concepts
likewise may be determined. If this were not true
we should be very much disappointed with what we
find in the phenomenal world and could never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
quite sure that the mentograph existing in our minds
was a faithful representation of the thing which we
might be examining. But really the foundation for
such a disappointment is present in every concept, every
percept with which the mind deals. This disappointment,
although in actual experience is reduced to an
almost negligible quantity, is due to the failure of
sensuous objects to conform wholly to the specific details
of the mental shadow or mentograph. This lack
of congruence between the mental picture and the object
itself is necessary for obvious reasons. It is
markedly observable in the early efforts of a child in
learning distances, weights, resistances, temperatures
and the like. No inconsiderable time is required for
the child to be able correctly to harmonize his sense-deliveries
with actual conditions. Otherwise, the
child would never make any of the ludicrous mistakes
of judgment of which it is guilty when trying to get its
bearings in the world of the senses. In the course of
time the child gradually learns by experience that certain
things are true of objects, distances, temperatures,
resistances, etc., and that certain things are not true
of them. He learns these things by actually contacting
various objects. He is then competent to render
correct judgments, within certain limits, as to the conditions
which he finds in the sensible world. And the
allowances, equations and corrections which his motor,
sensory and psychic mechanisms learn to make in childhood
serve for all subsequent time. And this is important
to remember; for the mature mind is apt to
forget or overlook the adaptations which the child-mind
has made in its growth.</p>

<p>If there were no such differences between the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>cept
and the thing itself, actual physical contact would
not be necessary. For one could rely wholly upon the
sense-deliveries and each sense might operate entirely
independently of all the others as there would be no
necessity to correct the delivery of one by those of the
others. This, of course, raises the question as to the
necessity of sense-experience at all under conditions
where there would be no disparity between the thing
itself and the ideal representation of it in the mind.
The absence of this variable quantity would open to
the mind the possibility of really knowing the essential
nature of objects in the phenomenal world, a condition
of affairs which is admittedly now without the
range of the powers of the mind.</p>

<p>At any rate, the essential "thingness" of objects
can never be comprehended by the mind until the
diminution of this disparity between the object of sense
and the mental picture of it which exists in the consciousness
has proceeded to such a limit as either completely
to have obliterated it or to such an extent
that the psychic fluxion is so slight as not to matter.</p>

<p>It is believed that the results of mental evolution,
as the mind approaches the transfinite as a limit, will
operate to minimize the fluxional quantity which subsists
between all objects of sense and their ideal representation
as data of consciousness. The conclusion
that the mind of early men who lived hundreds of
thousands and perhaps millions of years ago on this
planet consumed a much longer time in learning the
adjustments between the objects which it contacted in
the sensuous world and the elementary representations
which were registered in its youthful consciousness
than is to-day required for similar processes seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
be demanded, and substantiated as well, by what is
known of the phyletic development of the mind in the
human race.</p>

<p>In view of the above, it is thought that the duration
of such simple mental processes served not only to
prolong the physical life of the man of those early
days, but may also account for the puerility and incapacity
of the mind at that stage. Not that the slow
mental processes were active causative agencies in
lengthening the life of man, but that they together
with the crass physicality of man necessitated a longer
physical life. This, perhaps in a larger sense than
any other consideration, accounts for the fundamental
discrepancies in the mind of the primitive man in comparison
with the efficiency of the mind of the present-day
man. In view of the potential character of mind
and in the light of the well graduated scale of its accomplishments,
it is undoubtedly safe to conclude that
the quality of mental capacities is proportional to the
psychic fluxional which may exist at any time between
the ideal and the essential or real. Mental differences
and potentialities in general may be due to the magnitude
of the psychic fluxional or differential that exists
between the conceptual and the perceptual universe.
In some minds it may be greater than in others. The
chasm between things-in-themselves and the mental
notion pertaining thereto may vary in a direct ratio to
the individual mind's place in psychogenesis, and therefore,
be the key to all mental differences in this respect.</p>

<p>Most certain it is that there may be marked fluctuations
in the judicial approach of minds towards
any psychic end. In other words, there is not only a
fluxional or differential between the object and its rep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>resentation,
but also a differential between the approach
of one mind and another in the judicial determination
of notions concerning ideas. In this way,
differences of opinions as to the right and wrong of
judgments arise. Indeed, there seem to be zones
of affinity for minds of similar characteristics, or
minds that have the same degree of differential; so
that, in choosing among the many possible judgments
predicable upon a species of data, all those
minds having the same degree of psychic differential
discover a special affinity or agreement among
themselves. Hence, we have cults, schools of thought,
and various other sectional bodies that find a basis of
agreement for their operations in this way. The outcome
of this remarkable intellectual phenomenon is
that there are as many different kinds of judgments as
there are zones of affinity among minds. Various systems
of philosophy owe their existence to these considerations,
and the considerations themselves flow
from the fact that all intellectual operations are essentially
superficial; because there is no means by which
they may penetrate to the steady flowing stream of
reality which pervades and sustains objects in the sensible
world.</p>

<p>In view, therefore, of the foregoing and with
special reference to geometric constructions, it is necessary
in approaching a study of the four-space that it be
understood at the outset that the fourth dimension can
neither be actualized nor made objectively possible
even in the slightest degree in the perceptual world;
because it belongs to the world of pure thought and
exists there as an "extra personal affair," separate and
distinct from the world of the senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>As says <span class="smcap">Simon Newcomb</span>:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The experience of the race and all the refinements
of modern science may be regarded as showing
quite conclusively that, within the limits of our
experience, there is no motion of material masses, in
the direction of a fourth dimension, no physical
agency which we can assume to have its origin in
regions to which matter cannot move, when it has
three degrees of freedom."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is, however, no logical objection to the study
of the fourth dimension as a purely hypothetical question,
if by pursuit of the same an improvement of
methods of research and of the outlook upon the field
of the actual may be gained. Hence, it is with this
attitude of mind that we approach the consideration of
the fourth dimension.</p>

<p>Various efforts have been made to render the conception
of a fourth dimension of space thinkable. The
student of space has reasoned: "We say that there
are three dimensions of space. Why should we stop
here? May there not be spaces of four dimensions and
more?" Or he has said: "If 'A' may represent the
side of a square, A<sup>2</sup> its area, and A<sup>3</sup> the volume of a
cube with edge equal to A; what may A<sup>4</sup>, A<sup>5</sup> or A<sup><i>n</i>th</sup> represent
in our space? The conclusion, with respect to
the quantity A<sup>4</sup>, has been that it should represent a
space of four dimensions."</p>

<p>Algebraic quantities, however, represent neither
objects in space nor space qualities except in a purely
conventional manner. All efforts to justify the objective
existence of a fourth dimension based upon such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
reasoning will, therefore, fail; because the basis of
such arguments is itself faulty. In the sentence: "The
man loves his bottle," the thing meant is not the bottle,
but what the bottle contains. For the purpose of the
figure the bottle signifies its contents. There is no
more real connection between the bottle and what it
contains than between any word and the object for
which it stands. Words are said to be symbols of
ideas. But they are not natural symbols; they are
conventional symbols, made for the purpose of cataloguing,
indexing and systematizing our knowledge.
Words can be divorced from ideas and objects, or
rather have never had any real connection with them.
There are two classes of natural symbols, namely;
<i>objects</i> and <i>ideas</i>. These, objects and ideas, symbolize
realities. Realities are imperceptible and incomprehensible
to the intellect which has aptitude only for
a slight comprehension of the symbols of realities.
For instance, a tree is a natural symbol. It represents
an actuality which is imperceptible to the intellect. The
intellect can deal only with the sensible symbol. It is
a natural symbol; because it is possible directly to trace
a living connection between the tree and the <i>tree-reality</i>.
That is, it would be possible so to trace out
the vital connection between the tree and its reality
if the intellect had aptitude for such tracery. But, in
reality, since it has no such aptitude, it remains for the
work of that higher faculty than the intellect which
recognizes both the connection and the intellect's inability
to trace it. Further, an object is called a
natural symbol because it is the bridge between sensuous
representation and reality. It is as if one could
begin at the surface of an object and by a subtle proc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>ess
of elimination and excortication arrive at the heart
of the universum of reality. No such consummation
may be reached by dealing with words which have
merely an artificial relationship with the objects which
they signify. Again, ideas, that is, ideas that are universal
in application and have their roots in the great
ocean of reality, are natural symbols; because if it were
possible to handle an idea with the physical hands
it would be possible to arrive at the heart of that
which it symbolized without ever losing our connection
with the idea itself. In other words, ideas and
objects, unlike words, can never be divorced from that
which they symbolize. Both, being of the same class,
are the opposite poles of realities. This then is the
difference between natural symbols and artificial symbols&mdash;that
a natural symbol, such as objects and ideas,
is copolar with reality whereas an artificial symbol,
such as words, geometric constructions and the like
not only lacks this copolarity but is itself a symbol
of natural symbols.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, inconceivable that because the
algebraic quantity A<sup>3</sup> has been arbitrarily decreed to
be a representation of the volume of a cube, every
such quantity in the algebraic series shall actually
represent some object or set of objects in the physical
world. Even if it be granted that such may be the
case, is it not certain that there is a limit to things
in the objective universe? Yet there may not be any
limit to algebraic or mathematical determinations.
The material universe is limited and conditioned; the
world of mathesis is unlimited and unconditioned save
by its own limitations and conditions. It is irrational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to expect that physical phenomena shall justify all
mathematical predicates.</p>

<p><i>There is perhaps no single mathematical desideratum
or consideration which may be said to be the
natural symbolism of realities; for the whole of mathematical
conclusions is a mass of artificial and arbitrary
but concordant symbols of the crasser or nether pole
of the antipodes of realism.</i> It is exceedingly dangerous,
therefore, to predicate upon such a far-fetched
symbolism as mathematics furnishes anything purporting
to deal with ultimate realities. And those who
insist upon doing so are either blind themselves to
these limitations or are madly endeavoring to befog
the minds of others who are dependent upon them
for leadership in questions of mathematical import.</p>

<p>Analogies have been unsparingly used in efforts to
popularize the four-space conception and much of the
violence which has been done to the notion is due to
this vagary. The mathematical publicist, in trying to
give a mental picture of the fourth dimension, examines
the appearances of three dimensional beings as they
might appear to a two dimensional being or <i>duodim</i>.
He imagines a race of beings endowed with all the
human faculties except that they live in a land of but
two dimensions&mdash;length and breadth. He thinks of
them as shadows of three dimensional beings to whom
there are no such conceptions as "up" and "down."
They can see nothing nor sense anything in any way
that is without their plane. They can move in any
direction within the plane in which they live, but can
have no idea of any movement that might carry them
without that plane. A house for such beings might
be simply a series of rectangles. One of them might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
be as safe behind a line as a <i>tridim</i> or three dimensional
being would be behind a stone wall. A bank
safe for the <i>unodim</i> would be a mere circle. A <i>duodim</i>
in any two dimensional prison might be rescued by
a tridim without the opening of doors or the breaking
of walls. An action of a <i>tridim</i> performed so as to
contact their plane would be to them a miracle, absolutely
unaccountable upon the basis of any known fact
to the <i>unodim</i> or <i>duodim</i>. A <i>tridim</i> might go into
a house where lived a family of <i>duodims</i>, appear and
disappear without being detected or its ever being discovered
how he accomplished such a marvelous feat.
Our miracles, after the same fashion, are said to be
the antics of some four dimensional being who has
similar access to our three dimensional world and
whose actions are similarly inexplicable to us. So the
analogies have been multiplied. But the temptation
to apply the consequences of such reasoning to actual
three-space conditions has been so great that many
have yielded to it and have consequently sought
actually to explain physical phenomena upon the basis
of the fourth dimension.</p>

<p>The utilitarian side of the question of hyperspace
has not been neglected either. And so, early in the
development of the hypothesis and its various connotations,
the attention of investigators was turned to
this aspect of the inquiry. Strange possibilities were
revealed as a result. For instance, it was found that
an expert fourth dimensional operator is possessed of
extraordinary advantages over ordinary tridimensional
beings. Operating from his mysterious hiding
place in hyperspace, he could easily appear and disappear
in so mysterious a manner that even the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
strongly sealed chests of treasures would be easily and
entirely at his disposal. No city police, Scotland Yard
detective nor gendarme could have any terrors for
him. <span class="smcap">Drs. Jekyll</span> and <span class="smcap">Messrs. Hyde</span> might abound
everywhere without fear of detection. Objects as
well as persons might be made to pass into or out of
closed rooms "without penetrating the walls," thus
making escape easy for the imprisoned. No tridimensional
state, condition or system of arrangements,
accordingly, would be safe from the ravages of evilly
inclined four dimensional entities. Objects that now
are limited to a point or line rotation could in the
fourth dimension rotate about a plane and thus
further increase the perplexities of our engineering
and mechanical problems; four lines could be erected
perpendicular to each other whereas in three space
only three such lines can be erected; the right hand
could be maneuvered into the fourth dimension and
be recovered as a left hand; the mysteries of growth,
decay and death would find a satisfactory explanation
on the basis of the fourth dimensional hypothesis and
many, if not all, of the perplexing problems of
physiology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, anthropology
and psychology would yield up their mysteries
to the skill of the fourth dimensional operator.
Marvelous possibilities these and much to be desired!
But the most remarkable thing about these so-called
possibilities is their impossibility. It is this kind of
erratic reasoning that has brought the conception of a
fourth dimension into general disrepute with the popular
mind. It is to be regretted, too, for the notion
is a perfectly legitimate one in the domain of mathesis
where it originated and rightly belongs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that metageometricians
and others should at first surmise that, in the four-space,
they had found the key to the deep mysteries
of nature in all branches of inquiry. For so vast was
the domain and so marvelous were the possibilities
which the new movement revealed that it was to be
expected that those who were privileged to get the
first glimpses thereof would not be able to realize fully
their significance. But the stound of their minds and
the attendant magnification of the elements which they
discovered were but incidents in the larger and more
comprehensive process of adjustment to the great outstanding
facts of psychogenesis which is only faintly
foreshadowed in the so-called hyperdimensional. The
whole scope of inquiry connected with hyperspace is
not an end in itself. It is merely a means to an end.
And that is the preparation of the human mind for
the inborning of a new faculty and consequently more
largely extended powers of cognition. Metageometrical
discoveries are therefore the excrescences of
a deeper, more significant world process of mental unfoldment.
They belong to the matutinal phenomena
incident to this new stage of mental evolution. All
such investigations are but the preliminary exercises
which give birth to new tendencies which are destined
to flower forth into additional faculties and capacities.
So that it is well that the evolutionary aspect of the
question be not overlooked; for there is danger of this
on account of the magnitude and kosmic importance
of its scope of motility.</p>

<p>A geometric line is said to be a space of one dimension.
A plane is a space of two dimensions and a
cube, a space of three dimensions. In figure 7 below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the line <i>ab</i> is said to be one dimensional; because only
one coördinate is necessary to locate a point-position
in it. The plane, <i>abcd</i>, figure 8, is said to be two dimensional
because two coördinates, <i>ab</i> and <i>db</i> are required
to locate a point, as the point <i>b</i>. The cube
<i>abcdefgh</i>, figure 9, is said to be tridimensional, because,
in order to locate the point <i>b</i>, for instance, it is necessary
to have three coördinates, <i>ab</i>, <i>bc</i> and <i>gb</i>. The
tesseract is said to be four dimensional, because, in
order to locate the point <i>b</i>, in the tesseract, it is necessary
to have four coördinates, <i>ab</i>, <i>bc</i>, <i>bb'</i> and <i>h'b</i>, figure
10.</p>

<p>The line <i>ab</i> represents a one-space. An entity
living in a one space is called a "unodim." The plane,
<i>abcd</i>, represents a two-space, and entities living in such
a space are called <i>duodims</i>. The cube, <i>abcdefgh</i>,
represents a three-space and entities inhabiting such
a space are called <i>tridims</i>. Figure 10 represents a
four-space, and its inhabitants are called <i>quartodims</i>.
Each of the above-mentioned spaces is said to have
certain limitations peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>The fourth dimension is said to lie in a direction
at right angles to each of our three-space directions.
This, of course, gives rise to the possibility of generating
a new kind of volume, the hypervolume. The
hypercube or tesseract is described by moving the
generating cube in the direction in which the fourth
dimension extends. For instance, if the cube, Fig.
9, were moved in a direction at right angles to each
of its sides a distance equal to one of its sides, a figure
of four dimensions, the tesseract, would result.</p>

<p>The initial cube, <i>abcc'e'fhh'</i>, when moved in a direction
at right angles to each of its faces, generates the
hypercube, Fig. 10. The lines, <i>aa'</i>, <i>bb'</i>, <i>cc'</i>, <i>dd'</i>, <i>ee'</i>,
<i>ff'</i>, <i>gg'</i>, <i>hh'</i>, are assumed to be perpendicular to the
lines meeting at the points, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>. Hence
<i>a'b'</i>, <i>b'd</i>, <i>dd'</i>, <i>d'a'</i>, <i>ef</i>, <i>fg</i>, <i>gg'</i>, <i>g'e</i>, represent the final
cube resulting from the hyperspace movement. Counting
the number of cubes that compose the hypercube
we find that there are eight. The generating cube,
<i>abcc'e'f'hh'</i>, and the final cube, <i>a'b'</i>, <i>b'd</i>, <i>dd'</i>, <i>d'a'</i>, <i>ef</i>, <i>fg</i>,
<i>gg'</i>, <i>g'e</i>, make two cubes; and each face generates a
cube making eight in all. A tesseract, therefore, is a
figure bounded by eight cubes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>To find the different elements of a tesseract, the
following rules will apply:</p>

<p>1. <i>To find the number of lines</i>: Multiply the number
of lines in the generating cube by two, and add a
line for each point or corner in it. E.g., 2 × 12
= 24 + 8 = 32.</p>

<p>2. <i>To find the number of planes, faces or squares</i>:
Multiply the number of planes in the generating cube
by 2 and add a plane for each line in it. E.g., 2 × 6
+ 12 = 24.</p>

<p>3.  <i>To find the number of cubes in a hypercube</i>:
Multiply the number of cubes in the generating cube,
one, by two and add a cube for each plane in it. E.g.,
2 × 1 + 6 = 8.</p>

<p>4. <i>To find the number of points or corners</i>: Multiply
the number of corners in the generating cube by
2. E.g., 2 × 8 = 16.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a plane there may be three points each equally
distant from one another. These may be joined, forming
an equilateral triangle in which there are three
vertices or points, three lines or sides and one surface.</p>

<p>In three-space there may be four points each equidistant
from the others. At the vertices of a regular
tetrahedron may be found such points. The tetrahedron
has four points, one at each vertex, 6 lines and
4 equilateral triangles, as in Fig. 11.</p>

<p>In four-space, we have 5 points each equidistant
from all the rest, giving the hypertetrahedron. This
four dimensional figure may be generated by moving
the tetrahedron in the direction of the fourth dimension,
as in Fig. 12. If a plane be passed through each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of the six edges of the tetrahedron and the new vertex
there will be six new planes or faces, making 10 in
all, counting the original four. From the new vertex
there is also a tetrahedron resting upon each base
of the original tetrahedron so that there are five tetrahedra
in all. <i>A hypertetrahedron is a four-dimensional
figure consisting of five tetrahedra, ten faces,
10 lines and 5 points.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul Carus</span><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> suggests the use of mirrors so
arranged that they give eight representations of a cube
when placed at their point of intersection. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If we build up three mirrors at right angles and
place any object in the intersecting corner we shall
see the object not once, but eight times. The body
is reflected below and the object thus doubled is
mirrored not only on both upright sides but in addition
in the corner beyond, appearing in either of the
upright mirrors coincidingly in the same place.
Thus the total multiplication of our tridimensional
boundaries of a four dimensional complex is rendered
eight-fold.</p>

<p>"We must now bear in mind that this representation
of a fourth dimension suffers from all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
faults of the analogous figure of a cube in two
dimensional space. The several figures are not eight
independent bodies but are mere boundaries and
the four dimensional space is conditioned by their
interrelation. It is that unrepresentable something
which they inclose, or in other words, of which they
are assumed to be boundaries. If we were four
dimensional beings we could naturally and easily
enter into the mirrored space and transfer tridimensional
bodies or parts of them into those other
objects reflected here in the mirrors representing the
boundaries of the four dimensional object. While
thus on the one hand the mirrored pictures would
be as real as the original object, they would not
take up the space of our three dimensions, and in
this respect, our method of representing the fourth
dimension by mirrors would be quite analogous to
the cube pictured on a plane surface, for the space
to which we (being limited to our tridimensional
space-conception), would naturally relegate the
seven additional mirrored images is unoccupied
and if we should make the trial, we would find it
empty."</p></blockquote>

<p>The utility of such a representation as that which
<span class="smcap">Carus</span> outlines in the above is granted, i.e., so far as
the purpose which it serves in giving a general idea
of what a four-space object might be imagined to be
like, but the illustration does not demonstrate the existence
of a fourth dimension. It only shows what
might be if there were a four-space in which objects
could exist and be examined. We, of course, have
no right to assume that because it can be shown by
analogous reasoning that certain characteristics of the
fourth dimensional object can be represented in three-space
the possible existence of such an object is thereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
established. Not at all. For there is no imaginable
condition of tridimensional mechanics in which an
object may be said to have an objective existence
similar to that represented by the mirrored cube.</p>

<p>But there are discrepancies in this representation
which well might be considered. They have virtually
the force of invalidating somewhat the conception
which the analogy is designed to illustrate. For instance,
in the case of the mirrored object placed at
the point of intersection of the three mirrors built up
at right angles to each other. Upon examination of
such a construction it is found that the reflection of
the object in the mirrors has not any perceptible connection
with the object itself. And this, too, despite
the fact that they are regarded as boundaries of the
hypercube; especially is this true when it is noted that
these reflections are called upon to play the part of
real, palpable boundaries. If a fourth dimensional
object were really like the mirror-representation it
would be open to serious objections from all viewpoints.
The replacement of any of the boundaries
required in the analogy would necessarily mean the
replacement of the hypercube itself. In other words,
if the real cube be removed from its position at the
intersection of the mirrors no reflection will be seen,
and hence no boundaries and no hypercube. The
analogy while admittedly possessing some slight value
in the direction meant, is nevertheless valueless so far
as a detailed representation is concerned. So the
analogy falls down; but once again is the question
raised as to whether the so-called fourth dimension can
be established or proven at all upon purely mathematical
grounds. It also emphasizes the necessity for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
a clearer conception of the meaning of dimension and
space.</p>

<p>The logical difficulties which beset the hyperspace
conception are dwelt upon at length by <span class="smcap">James H.
Hyslop</span>. He says:<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The supposition that there are three dimensions
instead of one, or that there are only three
dimensions is purely arbitrary, though convenient
for certain practical purposes. Here the supposition
expresses only differences of directions from an
assumed point. Thus what would be said to lie
in a plane in one relation would lie in the third
dimension in another. There is nothing to determine
absolutely what is the first, second, or third
dimension. If the plane horizontal to the sensorium
be called plane dimension, the plane vertical to it
will be called solid, or the third dimension, but a
change of position will change the names of these
dimensions without involving the slightest qualitative
change or difference in meaning.</p>

<p>"Moreover, we usually select three lines or
planes terminating vertically at the same point, the
lines connecting the three surfaces of a cube with
the same point, as the representative of what is
meant by three dimensions, and reduce all other
lines and planes to these. But interesting facts are
observable here. 1. If the vertical relation between
two lines be necessary for defining a dimension, then
all other lines than the specified ones are either not
in any dimension at all, or they are outside the
three given dimensions. This is denied by all
parties, which only shows that a vertical relation
to other lines is not necessary to the determination
of a dimension. 2. If lines outside the three vertically
intersecting lines still lie in dimension or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
are reducible to the other dimensions they may lie
in more than one dimension at the same time
which after all is a fact. This only shows that
qualitatively all three dimensions are the same
and that any line outside of another can only represent
a dimension in the sense of <i>direction</i> from a
given point or line, and we are entitled to assume
as many dimensions as we please, all within three
dimensions.</p>

<p>"This mode of treatment shows the source of
the illusion about the 'fourth dimension.' The term
in its generic import denotes commensurable quality
and denotes only one such quality, so that the
property supposed to determine non-Euclidean
geometry must be qualitatively different from this,
if its figures involve the necessary qualitative differentiation
from Euclidean mathematics. But this
would shut out the idea of 'dimension' as its basis
which is contrary to the supposition. On the other
hand, the term has a specific meaning which as
different qualitatively from the generic includes a
right to use the generic term to describe them
differentially, but if used only quantitatively, that
is, to express direction as it, in fact, does in these
cases, involves the admission of the actual, not a
supposititious, existence of a fourth dimension
which again is contrary to the supposition of the
non-Euclidean geometry. Stated briefly, dimension
as commensurable quality makes the existence of
the fourth dimension a transcendental problem, but
as mere direction, an empirical problem. And the
last conception satisfies all the requirements of the
case because it conforms to the purely quantitative
differences which exist between Euclidean and non-Euclidean
geometry as the very language about
'surfaces,' 'triangles,' etc., in spite of the prefix
'pseudo,' necessarily implies."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it would seem that those who have been
most diligent in constructing the hyperspace conception
have been the least careful of the logical difficulties
which beset the elaboration of their assumptions.
Yet it sometimes requires the illogical, the absurd and
the aberrant to bring us to a right conception of the
truth, and when we come to a comparison of the two,
truth and absurdity, we are the more surprised that
error could have gained so great foothold in face of
so overwhelming evidences to the contrary.</p>

<p>The entire situation is, accordingly, aptly set forth
by <span class="smcap">Hyslop</span> when he says, continuing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are either a confusion of the abstract
with the concrete or of quantitative with qualitative
logic, ... so that all discussion about a fourth
dimension is simply an extended mass of equivocations
turning upon the various meanings of the term
'dimension.' This when once discovered, either
makes the controversy ridiculous or the claim for
non-Euclidean properties a mere truism, but effectually
explodes the logical claims for a new dimensional
quality of space as a piece of mere jugglery
in which the juggler is as badly deceived as his
spectators. It simply forces mathematics to transcend
its own functions as defined by its own advocates
and to assume the prerogatives of metaphysics."</p></blockquote>

<p>Shall we, therefore, assent to the imperialistic policy
of mathematicians who would fain usurp the preserves
of the metaphysician in order that they may exploit
a superfoetated hypothesis? It is not believed that
the harshness of <span class="smcap">Hyslop's</span> judgment in this respect
is undeserved. It is, however, regretted that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
notions of mathematicians have been so inchoate as to
justify this rather caustic, though appropriate criticism.
For it does appear that the moment the mathematician
deserts the province of his restricted sphere of motility
and enters the realm of the transcendental, that moment
he loses his way and becomes an inexperienced mariner
on an uncharted sea.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that <span class="smcap">Cassius Jackson
Keyser</span>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> while recognizing the purely arbitrary character
of the so-called dimensionality of space, nevertheless
lends himself to the view that "if we think of
the line as generating element we shall find that our
space has four dimensions. That fact may be seen in
various ways, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A line is determined by any two of its points.
Every line pierces every plane. By joining the
points of one plane to all the points of another, all
the lines of space are obtained. To determine a
line, it is, then, enough to determine two of its
points, one in the one plane and one in the other.
For each of these determinations two data, as
before explained, are necessary and sufficient. The
position of the line is thus seen to depend upon four
independent variables, and the four dimensionality
of our space <i>in lines</i> is obvious."</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly he argues for the four dimensionality of
space in spheres:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We may view our space as an assemblage of
its spheres. To distinguish a sphere from all other
spheres, we need to know four and but four independent
facts about it, as say, three that shall de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>termine
its center and one its size. Hence our space
is four dimensional also in spheres. In circles, its
dimensionality is six; in surfaces of second order
(those that are pierced by a straight line in two
points), nine; and so on ad infinitum."</p></blockquote>

<p>The view taken by <span class="smcap">Keyser</span> is a typical one.
It is the mathematical view and is characterized
by a certain lack of restraint which is found to be
peculiar to the whole scheme of thought relating to
hyperspace. It is clear that the kind of space that
will permit of such radical changes in its nature as
to be at one time three dimensional, at another time
four dimensional, then six, nine and even <i>n</i>-dimensional
is not the kind of space in which the objective
world is known to exist. Indeed, it is not the kind of
space that really exists at all. In the first place, a line
cannot generate perceptual space. Neither can a circle,
nor a sphere nor any other geometrical construction.
It is, therefore, not permissible, except mathematically,
to view our space either as "an assemblage of its
spheres," its circles or its surfaces; for obviously perceptual
space is not a geometrical construction even
though the intellect naturally finds inhering in it a
sort of latent geometrism which is kosmical. For there
is a wide difference between that kosmic order which
is space and the finely elaborated abstraction which the
geometer deceives himself into identifying with space.
There is absolutely neither perceptible nor imperceptible
means by which perceptual space in anywise
can be affected by an act of will, ideation or movement.
Just why mathematicians persist in vagarizing upon
the generability of space by movement of lines, circles,
planes, etc., is confessedly not easily understood espe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>cially
when the natural outcome of such procedure is
self-stultification. It is far better to recognize, as a
guiding principle in all mathematical disquisitions respecting
the nature of space that the possibilities found
to inhere in an idealized construction cannot be objectified
in kosmic, sensible space. The line of demarkation
should be drawn once for all, and all
metageometrical calculations and theories should be
prefaced by the remark that: "if objective space were
amenable to the peculiarities of an idealized construction
such and such a result would be possible," or
words to that effect. This mode of procedure would
serve to clarify many if not all of the hyperspace
conceptions for the non-mathematician as well as for
the metageometricians themselves, especially those
who are unwilling to recognize the utter impossibility
of their constructions as applied to perceptual space.
We should then cease to have the spectacle of otherwise
well-demeanored men committing the error of
trying to realize abstractions or abstractionizing realities.
Herein is the crux of the whole matter, that
mathematicians, rather than be content with realities
as they find them in the kosmos, should seek to reduce
them to abstractions, or, on the other hand, make their
abstractions appear to be realities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keyser</span> proceeds to show how the concept of
the generability of hyperspace may be conceived by
beginning with the point, moving it in a direction
without itself and generating a line; beginning
with the line, treating it similarly, and generating
a plane; taking the plane, moving it in a direction at
right angles to itself and generating a cube; finally,
using the cube as generating element and constructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
a four-space figure, the tesseract. Now, as a matter
of fact, a point being intangible cannot be moved in
any direction neither can a point-portion of sensible
space be removed. Nevertheless, we quite agree with
him when he asserts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Certainly there is naught of absurdity in supposing
that <i>under suitable stimulation the human
mind may, in the course of time, speedily develop
a spatial intuition of four or more dimensions</i>."
(The italics in the above quotation are ours.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we have a tacit implication that the notion
which geometers have heretofore designated as "dimension"
really is a matter of consciousness, of intuition,
and therefore, determinable only by the limitations
of consciousness and the deliveries of our
intuitive cognitions. As a more detailed discussion of
this phase of the subject shall be entered into when
we come to a consideration of Chapter VI on "Consciousness
as the Norm of Space Determinations"
further comment is deferred until then.</p>

<p>Now, as it appears certain that what geometers
are accustomed to call "dimension" is both relative
and interchangeable in meaning&mdash;the one becoming
the other according as it is viewed&mdash;the conclusion
very naturally follows that neither constructive nor
symbolic geometry is based upon dimension as commensurable
quality. The real basis of the non-Euclidean
geometry is dimension as direction. For
whatever else may be said of the fourth dimension
so-called it is certainly unthinkable, even to the metageometricians,
when it is absolved from direction although
no specific direction can be assigned to it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
is agreed perhaps among all non-Euclidean publicists
that the fourth dimension must lie in a "direction which
is at right angles to all the three dimensions." But
if they are asked how this direction may be ascertained
or even imagined they are nonplused because they
simply do not know. The difficulty in this connection
seems to hinge about the question of identifying the
conditions of the world of phantasy with those of the
world of sense. There are distortions, ramifications,
submersibles, duplex convolutions and other mathetic
acrobatics which can be performed in the realm of the
conceptual the execution of which could never be
actualized in the objective world. Because these antics
are possible in the premises of the mathematical
imagination is scarce justification for the attempts at
reproduction in an actualized and phenomenal universe.</p>

<p>One of the proudest boasts of the fourth dimensionist
is that hyperspace offers the possibility of a
new species of rotation, namely, <i>rotation about a
plane</i>. He refers to the fact that in the so-called one-space,
rotation can take place only about a point. For
instance in Figure 7, the line <i>ab</i> represents a one-space
in which rotation can take place only about one of
the two points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. In Figure 8 which represents
a two-space, rotation may take place about the line
<i>ab</i> or the line <i>cd</i>, etc., or, in other words, the plane
<i>abcd</i> can be rotated on the axial line <i>ab</i> in the direction
of the third dimension. In tridimensional space
only two kinds of rotation are possible, namely, rotation
about a point and about a line. In the fourth
dimension it is claimed that rotation can take place
about a plane. For example, the cube in Figure 9, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
manipulation in the direction of the fourth dimension,
can be made to rotate about the side <i>abgf</i>.</p>

<p>A very ingenious argument is used to show how
rotation about a plane is thinkable and possible in
hyperspace. But with this, as with the entire fabric
of hyperspace speculations, dependence is placed almost
entirely upon analogous and symbolic conceptions
for evidence as to the consistency and rationality of
the conclusions arrived at.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig13.jpg" alt=""></img><br />
   <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 13.</span>
</div>

<p>It is urged that inasmuch as the rotation about
the line <i>bc</i> in Figure 13 would be incomprehensible
or unimaginable to a plane being for the reason
that such a rotation involves a movement of the
plane into the third dimension, a dimension of which
the plane being has no knowledge, in like manner
rotation about a plane is also unimaginable or incomprehensible
to a tridim or a three dimensional being.
It is shown, however, that the plane being, by making
use of the possibilities of an "assumed" tridimension,
could arrive at a rational explanation of line rotation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig14.jpg" alt=""></img><br />
   <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 14.</span>
</div>

<p>Figure 14 offers an illustration by means of which
a two dimensional mathematician could demonstrate
the possibility of line rotation. He is already acquainted
with rotation about a point; for it is the only
possible rotation that is observable in his two dimensional
world. By conceiving of a line as an infinity
or succession of points extending in the same direction;
imagining the movement of his plane in the
direction of the third dimension thereby generating
a cube and at the same time assuming that the lines
thus generated were merely successions of points
extending in the same direction, he could demonstrate
that the entire cube Figure 14, could be rotated about
the line <i>BHX</i> used as an axis. For upon this hypothesis
it would be arguable that a cube is a succession
of planes piled one upon the other and limited only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
by the length of the cube which would be extending
in the, to him, unknown direction of the third dimension.
He could very logically conclude that as a plane
can rotate about a point, a succession of planes constituting
a tridimensional cube, could also be conceived
as rotating about a line which would be a
succession of points under the condition of the hypothesis.
His demonstration, therefore, that the cube,
Figure 14, can be made to rotate around the line
<i>BHX</i> would be thoroughly rational. He could thus
prove line-rotation without even being able to actualize
in his experience such a rotation.</p>

<p>Analogously, it is sought by metageometricians to
prove in like manner the possibility of rotation about
a plane. Thus in Figure 16 is shown a cube which has
been rotated about one of its faces and changed from
its initial position to the position it would occupy when
the rotation had been completed or its final position
attained.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig16.jpg" alt=""></img><br />
   <span class="caption smcap">Fig. 16.</span>
</div>

<p>The gist of the arguments put forward as a basis
for plane-rotation is briefly stated thus: The face
<i>cefg</i> is conceived as consisting of an infinity of lines.
A cube, as in Figure 15, is imagined or assumed to
be sected into an infinity of such lines, each line being
the terminus of one of the planes which make up the
cube. Each one of the constituting planes is thought
of as rotating about its line-boundary which intersects
the side of the cube. The process is continued indefinitely
until the entire series of planes is rotated,
one by one, around the series of lines which constitute
the axial plane. Hence, in order that the cube, Figure
16, may change from its initial position to its final
position each one of the infinitesimal planes of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the cube is assumed to be composed must be made to
rotate about each one of the infinitesimal lines of
which the plane used as an axis is composed. In this
way, it is shown that the entire cube has been made
to rotate about its face, <i>cefg</i>. This concisely, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
"<span class="smcap">quod erat demonstrandum</span>" of the metageometrician
who sets out to prove rotation about a plane. Thus
it is made to appear that in order that tridimensional
beings may be enabled to conceive of four-space rotation,
as in Figures 15 and 16, in which the rotation
must also be thought of as taking place in the direction
of the fourth dimension, they must adopt the same
tactics that a two dimensional being would use to
understand some of the possibilities of the tridimensional
world.</p>

<p>It is, of course, unwise to assume that because a
thing can be shown to be possible by analogical reasoning
its actuality is thereby established. This consideration
cannot be too emphatically insisted upon;
for many have been led into the error by relying too
confidentially upon results based upon this line of
argumentation. There is a vast difference between
mentally doing what may be assumed to be possible,
the hypothetical, and the doing of what is actually
possible, the practical.</p>

<p>In the first place, plane-rotation in the actual universe
is a structural impossibility. The very nature
and constitution of material bodies will not admit of
such contortion as that required by the rotation of
a body, say a cube, about one of its faces. Let us
examine some of the results of plane rotation. 1. The
rotation must take place in the direction of the fourth
dimension. Now, as it is utterly impossible for any
one, whether layman or metageometrician, even to
imagine or conceive, in any way that is practical, the
direction of the fourth dimension it is also impossible
for one to move or rotate a plane, surface, line or
any other body in that direction. We are in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
beginning of the process of plane-rotation so-called
confronted with a physical impossibility. 2. Plane
rotation necessarily involves the orbital diversion of
every particle in the cube. This alone is sufficient to
prohibit such a rotation; for it is obvious that the
moment a particle or any series of particles is diverted
from its established orbital path disruption of that
portion of the cube must necessarily follow. This
upon the assumption that the particles of matter are
in motion and revolving in their corpuscular orbits.
3. Plane-rotation necessitates a radical change in the
absolute motion of each individual particle, electron,
atom or molecule of matter in the cube and a consequent
retardation or acceleration of this motion. This
upon the hypothesis that the particles of matter are
vibrating at the rate of absolute motion. 4. It presupposes
a reconstitution of each atom, molecule or
particle in the cube, changing the path of intra-corpuscular
rotation either from a right to left direction or
from a left to right direction, as the case may be.
The particles of matter in the cube will be acted upon
in much the same manner as the particles in a glove
when it is maneuvered in the fourth dimension. In
describing this phenomenon, <span class="smcap">Manning</span> says:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Every part by itself, in its own place is turned
over with only a slight possible stretching and slight
changing of positions of the different particles of
matter which go to make up the glove."</p></blockquote>

<p>The slight stretching and slight changing of the
positions of the particles referred to would be of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
consequence if applied to ponderable bodies. But
when used in connection with particles of matter which
are themselves of very infinitesimal size means far
more&mdash;enough, as we have said, to militate severely
against the integrity of the cube. It is not deemed
necessary to go further into the physical aspects of
plane-rotation as it is believed sufficient has been said
to negative the assumption from a purely structural
viewpoint.</p>

<p>Among the vagaries of hyperspace publicists none
is perhaps more notable than the view taken by C. H.
<span class="smcap">HINTON</span>:<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If it could be shown that the electric current
in the negative direction were exactly alike the electric
current in the positive direction, except for a
reversal of the components of the motion in three
dimensional space, then the dissimilarity of the discharge
from the positive and negative poles would
be an indication of the one-sidedness of our space.
The only cause of difference in the two discharges
would be due to a component in the fourth dimension,
which directed in one direction transverse to
our space, met with a different resistance to that
which it met when directed in the opposite direction."</p></blockquote>

<p>To be sure. And with equal certainty it might
be said that if the moon were made of green cheese
it might well be the ambition of the world's chefs to
be able at some time to flavor macaroni with it, thus
serving a rare dish. Even so, if there were an actual,
objective fourth dimension to our space we might be
able to shove into it all the perplexing problems of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
life and let it solve them for us. But the fact that
the fourth dimensional hypothesis is itself a mere supposition
seems to have been overlooked or rather
completely ignored by <span class="smcap">Hinton</span>. Or else, ought
it not be an obvious folly to hope to construct a rational
explanation of perplexing physical conditions
upon the basis of a purely suppositionary, and therefore
unproven, hypothesis?</p>

<p>The recognized domain of the four-space, mathematically
considered, is according to the most generous
allowance very small, so small, in fact, that the disposition
of some to crowd into it the essential content
of the manifested universe is a matter of profound
amazement. Then, too, it cannot be denied that there
is no appreciable urgency or necessity for having recourse
to a purely hypothetical construction for explicatory
data regarding a phenomenon which has not
been shown to be without the scope of ordinary
scientific methods of procedure to unravel.</p>

<p>The claim of certain spiritualists, notably <span class="smcap">Zollner</span>
of Leipsig, that the phenomena of spiritism
is accountable for on the grounds that the fourth
dimension affords a residential area for discarnate
beings whence spiritistic forayers may impose
their presence upon unprotected three dimensional
beings is no less fatuous than the original supposition
itself. For upon this latter is built the entire fabric
of meaningless speculations so gleefully indulged in
by those who glibly proclaim the reality of the four-space.
Indeed, clearer second thought will reveal that,
when the pendulum of erratic thinking and trafficking
in mental constructions swings back, hyperspaces, after
all, are but the <i>ignes fatuii</i> of mathetic obscurantism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, why should it be deemed necessary to discover
some more mysterious realm of four dimensional
proportions in which the spirits of the dead may
find a habitation? Are the spiritualists, too, reduced
to the necessity of further mystifying their already
adequately mysterious phenomena? If there were not
quite enough of physicality upon the basis of which
all the antics of these entities can be explained, and
that satisfactorily, one would, as a matter of course,
be inclined to lend some credence to these claims; but
as it is clear that all organized beings have some
power, if no more than that which maintains their
organization, and as it ought also be an acceptable fact
that such a being is directed by mind; and further,
that owing to the nature of a spirit body it can penetrate
solid matter or matter of any other degree of
density below the coefficient of spirit matter, it ought
likewise be unnecessary to go without the province
of strictly tridimensional mechanics for an explanation
of spiritistic phenomena.</p>

<p>Equally unnecessary and uncalled for is the attempt
of certain others who lean toward the view of speculative
chemists to account for the none too securely
established hypothesis that eight different alcohols,
each having the formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O may be produced
without variation. This is said to be due to the fact
that certain of the component atoms, notably the
carbon atoms, take a fourth dimensional position in
the compound and thus produce the unusual spectacle
of eight alcohols from one formula. Have chemists
actually exhausted all purely physical means of reaching
an understanding of the carbon compounds and
are therefore compelled to resort to questionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
means in order to make additional progress in their
field? It is incredible. Hence the more facetious
appears the mathematical extravaganza in which
originates the tendence among the more sanguine advocates
to make of the fourth dimension a sort of "jack
of all trades," a veritable "Aladdin's lamp" wherewith
all kosmic profundities may be illuminated and made
plain. Not until the perfection of instruments of precision
has been reached, and not until human ingenuity
has been exhausted in its efforts to produce more refined
methods of research should it be permissible
even to venture into untried and more or less debatable
fields in search of a relief which after all is
unobtainable.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that all attempts at accounting
for physical phenomena on the basis of
<i>n</i>-dimensionality (which is itself by all the standards of
objective reference a non-existent quantity and therefore
irreconcilable with perceptual space requirements) are
to be characterized simply as a senseless dalliance with
otherwise deeply profound questions, many have fallen
into a complete forgetfulness of the logical barriers
inhering in and hedging about the query and have
committed other and less excusable errors in the
premises. Take, for instance, the suggestion that the
action of a tartrate upon a beam of polarized light
is due to the assumption of a fourth dimensional
direction by some component in the acid. This for the
reason that experimentation has shown that tartaric
acid, in one form, will turn the plane of polarized
light to the right while in another form will turn it
to the left. It is not believed, however, that there is
any warrant for such an assumption. There is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
another kind of tartrate which seems to be neutral in
that it has no effect whatever upon the beam of light,
turning it neither to the right nor to the left nor
having other visible or determinable effect upon it.
Indeed, it is not clear how it is hoped to prove such
a case by constituting as a norm a hypothesis which
is essentially indemonstrable. A more logical procedure
would be first to establish the objective, discoverable
posture of four-space; show the actual
movement of matter and entities therein; locate it by
empirical methods of research, and then, basing our
assertions upon apodeictic evidences, assume a new
attitude toward these phenomena because of the support
found in established and verifiable facts. Some
hope of gaining a respectful hearing might then be
entertained; but at least to do so now appears to
be quite untimely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Major Wilmot E. Ellis</span>, Coast Artillery Corps,
United States Army, in <i>The Fourth Dimension Simply
Explained</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... in the ether, if anywhere, we should expect
to find some fourth dimensional characteristics.
Gravitation, electricity, magnetism and light are
known to be due to stresses in, or motions of, the
infinitesimal particles of the ether. The real nature
of these phenomena has never been fully explained
by three dimensional mathematical analysis. Indeed,
the unexplained residuum would seem to indicate
that so far we have merely been considering the
three dimensional aspects of four dimensional
processes. As one illustration of many, it has been
shown both mathematically and experimentally that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
no more than five corpuscles may have an independent
grouping in an atom."</p></blockquote>

<p>The weakness of this view may be due to the fact
that at that time <span class="smcap">Major Ellis</span> was emphasizing in
his own mind the necessity of simplifying the conception
so as to make it of easy comprehension rather
than the establishment of any fealty to truth or the
spirit of mathesis in his examination of the problem.
What therefore of reality the student fails to find in
his view may be attributed to the sacrifice which the
writer (<span class="smcap">Major Ellis</span>) felt himself called upon to
make for the sake of simplicity. Hence a certain expressed
connivance at his position is allowable. But,
on the other hand, if such were not the conscious
intent of <span class="smcap">Major Ellis</span> it is not understood how it
should appear that "the unexplained residuum would
seem to indicate that so far we have merely been
considering the three dimensional aspects of four
dimensional processes." Contrarily, it has yet to be
proved that three dimensional space does not afford
ample scope of motility for all observable or recognizable
physical processes and that there is no necessity
for reference to hyperspace phenomena for an
explanation of the "unexplained residuum." It is, of
course, understood that many of the possibilities
predicated for hyperspace are purely nonsensical so
far as their actual realization is concerned. Our concern
is, therefore, not with that class of predicates,
but with those wherein reside some slight show of
probability of their response to the conditions of
n-dimensionality either as a system of space-measurement
or a so-called space or series of spaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Major Ellis</span> concludes his simple study of four-space
by proposing the following query:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"May not birth be an unfolding through the
ether into the symmetrical life-cell, and death, the
reverse process of a folding-up into four dimensional
unity?"</p></blockquote>

<p>It is confessed that there seems to be nothing to
warrant the giving of an affirmative reply to this
query. It is, perhaps, sentimentally speaking a very
beautiful thing to contemplate death as a painless, unconscious
involvement into a glorious <i>one-ness</i> with all
life, and birth, as the reverse of all this. But where
is the utility of such a dream if it be merely a dream
and impossible of realization?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon Newcomb</span>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at one time one of the outstanding
figures in the early development of the
fourth dimensional hypothesis, openly declared that
"there is no proof that the molecule may not vibrate
in a fourth dimension. There are facts which seem
to indicate at least the possibility of molecular motion
or change of some sort not expressible in terms of
time and the three coördinates in space."</p>

<p>Of course, there is no proof that a molecule may
not at times be ensconced in a four-space neither is
there proof nor probability that it is so hidden. Indeed,
there is no proof that there is such a thing as
a molecule for that matter.</p>

<p>In all of the foregoing proposals it is assumed
that the fourth dimension really exists and that it lies
just beneath the surface of the visible, palpable limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of the material universe; that lying in close juxtaposition
to all that we are able to see, to hear or sense
in any way is this mysterious, eternally prolific, all-powerful
something, hyperspace, ever-ready to nourish
and sustain the forms which have the nether parts
firmly encysted in one or the other of her <i>n</i>-dimensional
berths. Thus it would seem that while yet
functioning in a strictly tridimensional atmosphere,
some one, more reckless than the rest, should at last
stumble upon some up-lying portion of it and be instantly
transformed into a mathetic fay of etherealized
four-dimensional stuff.</p>

<p>Things have value for us only to the extent to
which we can become aware of their being. The
appraisement of all objects, conditions, states or qualities
is determined directly by the degree or quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of awareness with which we apprehend them. Those
elements which are without the intellect's scope of
awareness have no interest and hence no value so far
as the individual intellect is concerned. And this is
true of all degrees and states of consciousness from
the lowest to the highest, from the human to the
divine.</p>

<p>There enter into all conscious determinations three
factors, namely: (<i>a</i>) the scope, or totality, of adaptations
which an organism can make in the sensible
world, (<i>b</i>) the power of consciousness to make adaptations
and (<i>c</i>) environment. These three are interdependent.
The totality of adaptations depends
primarily, of course, upon the quality of conscious
powers or faculties, and also, in a lesser degree, upon
opportunities afforded by environment. Faculties of
consciousness are derived directly from the influences
exerted upon the organism by his environment and
the results of the struggle to overcome them. Environment
is of two kinds, artificial and natural. The
artificial environment is such as has been modified by
our conscious action upon external phenomena. The
residue is natural. And thus the scope of adaptability
becomes an unvarying witness to the quality of consciousness
manifesting through a given organism.</p>

<p>The universe is so constructed that the essential
character of its various states and qualities is a fixed
quantity for a given scope of consciousness and varies
only as the sphere of consciousness varies. States of
existence or scopes of adaptation which are registering
upon a higher plane or in a more subtle sphere of
existence than that in which we may at any time be
functioning can only appear evidential to us when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
mechanism of our consciousness becomes congruently
adjusted therewith. So that the focus of consciousness
must always be a variable quantity adaptable, under
proper conditions, to any plane in the kosmos. Consciousness,
then, becomes the sphere of limits both
of knowledge and adaptability. But lest we seem to
admit implicitly part of the contentions which mathematical
publicists have made in postulating the unodim
and duodim consciousness, it is necessary carefully to
differentiate between the results arrived at as a result
of the two procedures. In the first place, analysts
<i>assume</i> the existence of a unodim and duodim plane
of consciousness and proceed to construct thereon an
analogy designed to show the feasibility of another
assumption, the fourth dimension. While, in laying
the foundation of consciousness upon a tridimensional
plane we do not start with an <i>assumption</i>, but with
a fact. Therein lies the difference. Enormous advantages
inhere in a procedure based upon facts, but
in a series of planes built upon assumptions no such
advantages are discovered. For however much the
series of hypothetical planes may be extended or
elaborated there must inhere necessarily throughout
the series an assumptional value which vitiates the
conclusions no less than the premises. The sanity
and integrity of intellectual operations depend almost
entirely upon the differentiation which we make between
the necessities arising out of assumptions and
those which spring up empirically from established
facts. No procedure is necessary to establish the
value of such a differentiation, nevertheless it may be
suggested that it is allowable, under the rules of logic,
to make any assumption whatsoever so long as care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
is taken to see that the conclusions embody in themselves
the characteristics of the original premise.
For instance, it is permissible to assume that space
is curved. Under such an assumption, it is only necessary
that the constructions which follow shall be
self-consistent. But the case is different when we come
to deal with spatiality and vitality. These are quantities
which cannot, in the last analysis, be made to
conform to the rules of the game of logic.</p>

<p>Thus, when it is intimated that realism lends itself
to an apparent division into degrees, and that each
degree has a corresponding state of consciousness, it
is by no means to be inferred that such apparent divisions
are of mathematical import. For, in reality,
i.e., when the consciousness has expanded so as to
become congruent with the limits of even the space
mind (vide Fig. 20), there appear to be no divisions
in realism. It is only because of the fragmentariness
of our outlook upon the kosmos that realism appears
to be divided into various planes; for all of these
planes are one. The divisions exist for relative knowledge,
but not for complete knowledge; they exist for
a finite intelligence, but not for a transfinite intelligence.
That is why we view realism as a series of
planes. It is because we discover that, as we proceed,
as our consciousness expands and we take in more and
more of the vital activities of the kosmos and understand
better the causes underlying that which we
contact, we have passed from a state of lesser knowledge
to one of greater knowledge. And so we say
we have passed from one degree of realism to another,
whereas, really we have not passed from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
degree of realism to another degree. Instead, it is
our consciousness that has expanded.</p>

<p>If now, we conceive reality to be a scale extending
from one extremity to another (that is, from supreme
consciousness to entire unconsciousness, from final
knowledge to total ignorance), and the intellectual
consciousness as the indicator which traverses the
scale denoting at all times the precise degree of our
comprehension of reality, and hence the degree of
expansion of consciousness, we shall constitute a similitude
closely approximating the real <i>status quo</i> of
humanity with respect to the sensible and supersensible
worlds. The quantity or force which causes the indicator
to move along the scale is the quality of awareness.
And this varies directly as the scope of adaptability
varies. Realism is homogeneous throughout its
extent; but the scale marked upon it registers from
<i>naught</i> to <i>unity</i>. And between these every conceivable
degree of awareness may be registered. The
indicator moves only as the scope widens, and thus is
shown a change in the quality of awareness. For,
however paradoxical it may seem, the wider the scope
of knowledge the better its quality: the more one
knows, the more complete and of higher quality becomes
that which he knows.</p>

<p>The intellect is of scientific tendence, studiously
rejecting all phenomena which do not yield to its
senso-mechanisms. Even intuitions suffer the humility
of rejection and do not escape the limitations which
the intellect imposes upon them. This is so, because,
as yet, there is no adequate perceptive and conceptive
apparatus for the propagation and classification of
intuitions, as apart from concepts. The outcome of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
these proscriptions is that intuitions&mdash;free, mobile, and
more or less formless in themselves, must first be
rehabilitated and vestured in garments <i>a la intellect</i>
to conform to the prevailing mode. But intuitions
thus treated are no longer intuitions, but empirical
concepts. True intuitions are like aqueous vapor&mdash;amorphous,
permeating, diffusive: axioms or empirical
concepts are like cakes of ice&mdash;formal, inflexible and
conforming to the shape of the mold into which they
are poured. Because of this&mdash;the scientific tendence
of the intellect and the consequent necessity of reforming
so much of the data which constitute its substructure,
of pressing, condensing and reshaping it to
suit its own ready-made patterns&mdash;it can be perceived
how profound is the influence of the intellectual consciousness
in determining the character of the totality
of data which the sensible world, and for that matter,
the supersensible, offer us. The intellect is the only
means at hand for the interpretation of the meaning
and significance of the world of phenomena. Consequently,
whatever meaning or significance we are led
to attach to that part of the universe which we contact,
in any way, is dictated by the intellectual consciousness.
There is no escape from the decisions of
the intellect so long as the present scheme of things
endures.</p>

<p>Thus, by whatever standard of reference the
matter may be determined, it remains indisputably
established that the intellectual consciousness is the
sole determinant of the phenomenal value of everything
within our scope of awareness or adaptability.
And whatever the fault, incongruity or discrepancy
that may be revealed by a more intimate knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of the genesis and character of the appearance of
the sensible world, it will be found to be due to the
peculiar cut and mode of the intellect and not to
things themselves. The value, qualitative or existential,
which the intellect irrevocably assigns to objects
and conditions in the world of the senses is the exclusive
<i>norm</i> not only by which these are judged, but
also, by which our action upon them and their action
upon us are determined. Images or objects which do
not act upon us and upon which we cannot act have
no interest for us. But as an integral part of the
totality of images or objects in the sensible world,
we must inevitably act upon all that is outside of
ourselves, and these, in turn, must react upon us. On
the other hand, there must be objects and images in
the universe of life and form upon which, because of
their inherent nature and on account of the lack of
our interest in them and their interest in us, we can
neither act nor become the object of their action.</p>

<p>But herein is a mystery. For, either we act upon
and are recipients of the action of the totality of
images or objects in both the sensible and supersensible
worlds, or we are so placed in the grand
scheme of things that both ourselves and the sphere
of our interests and possible actions are closed circuits,
hermetically sealed and non-communicative with
the other like spheres, which do not and cannot act
upon us. There is yet a third possibility&mdash;that we are
so fashioned, in the entirety of our being, that some
part of us is exactly congruent with some part of
every sphere of possible actions and interests in the
kosmos, and therefore, each of us has being or consciousness
of a kind that is keyed to and registering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
in the totality of such spheres; and that, at present,
because our interests and possible actions are limited
to the plane of sensibility, we are conscious only there.
And further, that although those spheres of our consciousness
which are fixed to register in other planes
do not answer to the lowest on which we now operate,
having a character of which we are unaware, they
nevertheless cannot be said not to exist, because of
the lack of communication between them. Among
these three possible choices, we have no hesitancy in
expressing a decided preference for the last mentioned&mdash;that
the range of our being is co-extensive with
the range of reality, and like a pendulum, we oscillate,
at long intervals, between two kosmic extremities&mdash;nescience
and omniscience.</p>

<p>The intellectual consciousness is the touch-stone of
realism. It is like a spreading light which, as it expands,
reveals previously darkened corners and conditions,
only it has power both to reveal and to bring
into manifestation. In its present state, man's consciousness
is like a searchlight. It illumines and takes
cognizance of everything that falls within its scope of
motility and is consequently able to study in detail
that which it reveals. But that which is beyond its
scope is as if it never existed so far as the individual
consciousness is concerned. It is not reasonable to
predict that the same characteristics that are observable
in any given state shall persist throughout all
the various scopes through which the consciousness
must proceed in its evolutionary expansion. For the
scale of kosmic realism is one grand panorama extending
from the grossest to the most subtle and refined.
While in general the thread of realism may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
pervade the entire scale it is nevertheless marked by
many and diverse changes in its characteristics as it
is followed from one stage to another. So that the
realistic character of one stage may vary greatly from
that which next preceded it or from that which will
succeed it. It would appear, therefore, that in passing
from one stage of realism to another there need
not remain anything but the mere fact of reality in
its connection with ultimate reality; for it is obvious
that in every condition of realism which may be encountered
in the kosmos there must be a basic thread
of ultimate reality running through the whole. The
entire gamut of realism may accordingly be traversed
without the danger of being diverted from the golden
thread of realism which thus permeates all. It is
always the phenomena of realism with which we are
concerned and which we are trying to understand
rather than realism itself. It is this that confounds
us. If it were not for the phenomena, which is the
way realism or life presents itself to our consciousness,
we should experience no trouble in discovering the
reality, all other things being equal. For the former
ever obscures the latter. It is the supreme task of
mental evolution to break through the clouds of phenomena
in the search for the eternal substratum of
reality which runs through the sensible universe of
things.</p>

<p>The first view of conditions that the mind takes
upon awakening to consciousness in any new sphere
of cognition is necessarily hazy and inchoate. There
is more or less of astonishment, wonder and bewilderment
upon first becoming aware of a new scope of
realism. In this state it is natural that the mind should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
overlook or ignore much that is essential and perhaps
all that is so even escaping the true import of the
phenomena which it senses. It is reasonable, too, that
in such a state the main outlines of what is really
seen may be greatly distorted and exaggerated so that
it is well-nigh impossible to secure a correct comprehension
of the character of a new scope of realism
from any early survey. It is not until later years,
after much study and circumspection that the mind,
becoming used to the new conditions, begins to get
correct impressions and to make valid judgments as
to that which it discerns. And even then, it not infrequently
happens that the resultant view of things
in general is found to be in need of revision and correction.
Hence, after everything is sifted down to
the ultimate allowance for the illusion incident to too
much enthusiasm and wonder we have only a very
small residuum of truth upon which to build and this
latter we often find to be the single thread of reality
which runs through all the phenomena and which is,
therefore, the only quantity that remains worthy of
much consideration.</p>

<p>Thus it is with religion. The path of progress
over which our religious conceptions have come need
not be outlined here, but to any one at all acquainted
with the history of religious thought and ideals it
at once must be patent that it has been one continuous
surrender of the old for the new, of one degree of
realism for another newer and higher degree; that
always it has been the phenomena, the flora of the
ideals which have had to give way, while nothing was
left but the roots of realism from which they have
sprung. It has been the same with scientific knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Facts have been collected and hypotheses proposed to
synthesize them and yet these have had to give way for
others, and others still, until the data of scientific knowledge
to-day are quite different from what they were
in earlier days. And yet permeating the scientific
knowledge of all times has been the golden thread
of reality, and of all facts and systems of facts which
man has successively assumed and surrendered nothing
has remained but the reality; indeed, nothing could
so remain, but reality. So it is with air phenomena
with which consciousness has to deal. This perhaps
is due to the fact that the mind interprets phenomena
in accordance with the quality of its awareness, and
as consciousness is a variable quantity, its standards of
interpretation will likewise vary. Each new scope of
awareness, after this manner, yields higher and more
exact standards of interpretation. And then, progressing
in awareness from the segment to the whole
a fuller view of the phenomena as well as of reality
itself is gained and also a more comprehensive judgment
of the relations which exist between the segment
and the whole. In other words, as the scope of
consciousness widens it becomes more and more apparent
that what was first thought to be a separate
segment is in reality identified with the whole in an
indissoluble manner. For the Thinker is then not
only aware of the segment as such, but he is also
conscious of the fact that it has definite relations with
the entirety and that what he needs is merely a more
extended consciousness.</p>

<p>In denying the existence of the four-space or
spaces of <i>n</i>-dimensionality as described and defined
by geometricians, we do not thereby deny the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of a plane of consciousness which is as much unlike
the conditions of the tridimensional world as it is said
to be unlike the four-dimensional world; but what we
do deny is that such a higher plane of existence has
necessarily to be conditioned by such characteristics
as the metageometricians have proposed. It is maintained
that there is no basis in consciousness for a
world of four dimensions; that the consciousness has
no tendency for action in four-space. Neither has
matter nor life any inclination or potency to behave
in a four-dimensional manner. It is indeed more rational
to suppose that there is a higher plane, in fact,
a series of higher planes, in which the thread of
realism is continuous, not broken as it necessarily
would have to be in extending to hyperspace, nor
curved as in a manifold; that this series of subtler
and finer planes of consciousness are merely an elongation
of our three dimensional scope of realism. It,
therefore, remains only to master the phenomena of
each in just the same manner as we have, in a measure,
mastered the phenomena of tridimensionality. For it
is easily conceivable that the quality of consciousness
is such that it may adapt itself to a far wider range
of possibilities than may be discovered in hyperspace
and still be a tri-space quantity.</p>

<p>It is believed, however, that in all the new and
higher planes of consciousness tridimensionality is the
norm both of the phenomena and of the reality
peculiar to them. And that, being such, does not
change or vary, but is a fixed quantity regardless of
the plane of consciousness. Furthermore, it is believed
that the highest state of consciousness in the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
kosmos could easily exist, and does so exist, upon the
basis of three-space as the norm of its extent.</p>

<p>A sharp line of demarkation should be drawn between
the reality which is life and consciousness and
that which belongs to the realm of phantasy. For it
is the prerogative of the intellect to create, out of
the remains and deposits which it finds in the pathway
of life, whatsoever it wills. This it does continuously;
but it scarcely can be expected that such creations
shall be endowed with the same dynamic character
as that which life bestows upon its creations.
The creations of the one are merely dead carcasses
while those of the other are vital and real. Between
them the same marked difference exists as between
the growing tree and the lumber which the builder
converts into a house. The organization which we
witness when we look upon a building made of the
dead body of a tree is not the same kind of organization
as that which we see when we view the living,
growing, vital tree. The dead tree is a deposit of
life cast off by it when it passed on. Whatever the
intellect can do in disposing of the remains of the
tree-life is conventional and artificial. If it convert
it into an edifice it will then bestow upon it a sort of
consistency which is quite sufficient for all purposes.
But the consistency which holds the organization of
an edifice together is not the kind of consistency which
holds a living tree together. In fact, there is a consistency
that is not consistent. Such is the consistency
of metageometry. It is self-consistent and yet inconsistent
with the consistency of the kosmos and its norm
of being which is consciousness.</p>

<p>Self-consistency is one thing and kosmic con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>sistency
is quite another. It does not necessarily follow
that because a given scheme of thought is consistent
in all its parts that it is also consistent with
universal truth or with life. This very vital fact was
overlooked by <span class="smcap">Gauss</span> and all those who followed in
his wake when he discovered that his <i>Astral Geometry</i>
was consistent throughout in all its parts. There
is only one norm of truth and that is kosmic consistency.
It matters little that a thing shall be self-consistent;
it matters much whether it is consistent
with the universal standard. It has been shown to
be logically possible to elaborate at least two different
systems of geometry, namely, the geometry of the
acute angle and that of the obtuse, which, while each
of them is self-consistent throughout, are nevertheless
inconsistent with each other and with the geometry
of the right angle (Euclidean). This, it would seem,
appears to be sufficient for the invalidation of either
one or both of the non-Euclidean systems of geometric
thought. Indeed, if it can be shown that the
Euclidean geometry is more representative of the true
approach to the norm of space-genesis and of creation
so far as its mode of manifestation is concerned, and
consequently true of the norm set up by consciousness,
the rejection of both systems of non-Euclidean
geometry seems to be thoroughly warranted. But this
is obvious and requires no demonstration nor comment
to make it clear. We have only to ask ourselves
whether it has ever occurred to us that consciousness
has either a tendency to or adaptability for action
in a curvilinear manner; or, if when we contemplate
ideas or idea-relations we have the impression of perceiving
a curvilinear or manifold tendence in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
either of a positive or negative nature, and also
whether it has been observed that our thought processes
naturally assume four-dimensional attitudes. If
we find that such a query must be answered negatively,
and indeed we must so find, then, we have no basis
for the assumption that any one of the systems of non-Euclidean
geometry is valid either for the present
status of consciousness or for a future existence, since
it is true that the future is but an elongation of the
present. Evolution is to bring no radical changes in
the norms of reality; it has merely to deepen and
widen and make more intense, efficient and comprehensive
the present scope of our consciousness and
thereby, while the Thinker is passing from one degree
of realism to another, to bring him into a clearer conception
of what his own limited scope of motility
means to the whole.</p>

<p>The four-space is a mathetic divertisement. That
is, it cannot be said to lie in the direction of a straight
line which proceeds either in a forward or lateral
direction. Neither does it lie in a plane which is
vertical or horizontal to the sensorium. It is, therefore,
a fractural departure from any conceivable tridimensional
direction, a geometric anomaly. Evolution,
despite the minor aspects of its movement,
undoubtedly proceeds in a straight line and not by a
zigzag nor discontinuous line and hence it is irrational
to assume that it will, when it passes on to the next advanced
stage, emerge into the realm of the four-space.
For the so-called hyperspace of geometry cannot by
any standards of reference be said to lie in the plane
of any straight line which can be described in three-space.
If life is to evolve more efficient forms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
if the forms are to evolve into more perfect organizations
and mind and consciousness to become more
intense and comprehensive expressions of the divine
mind of the kosmos it is certainly not in the domain
of hyperspace that these shall find the substructure of
their higher development; but, if at all, it shall be
found, as in all times past, in the realm of perceptual
space where bodies are said to have three and only
three possibilities of motion.</p>

<p>What then is the significance of the more than a
thousand years of mathematical labors; of all that
has been said and done in an endeavor to bring into
the popular consciousness a conception of hyperspace?
Is it a question of <i>"Love's Labour's Lost?"</i> Or is it
a mere prostitution of mathematical talent? To answer
these queries is the burden of this treatise and
it is hoped that as the text continues the reader may
be able to arrive at his own conclusions as to the
relative value of the work of the mathematicians in
this respect and be able to judge for himself the true
significance of it all.</p>

<p>The specific value of consciousness as a determinative
factor in space-measurement has been recognized
by all who have sought to arrive at a logical
justification for the conception of four-dimensionality
by analogous reasoning. The existence of the <i>unodim</i>
with consciousness limited to a line or point has been
assumed and it has been shown how greatly such a
being would be handicapped by his limited area of
consciousness, it having been proposed to confine his
consciousness to one dimension. An <i>unodim</i> would, of
course, be entirely unaware of any other dimension
than that in which he could consciously function. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
that with respect to his own consciousness no other
dimension would be necessary for the continuance of
his life processes. He might live his life without any
knowledge even of any limitations or barriers to other
things higher than those of his plane. He would be
content to exist in the one-space and enjoy the benefits
which it offered. He could have no notion of the
two-space, but it has been allowed that a <i>super-unodim</i>,
an <i>unodim</i> metageometrician, if you please, could
reason out a mental conception of what the two-space
might be. Passing on to a space of two dimensions,
the domain of the <i>duodim</i>, a greater freedom of movement
is allowed and instead of being able to function
in only one dimension the inhabitants of this plane
would find themselves able to move about in at least
two directions. Consciousness would accordingly enjoy
a more comprehensive scope. But in a manner similar
to that used by the <i>unodim</i> metageometrician it is held
that the <i>duodim</i> could get a conception of the three-space
by analogous reasoning and so gradually become
conscious of a higher degree of spatiality than his
own. In the conscious reasoning of both, however,
is the condition of perpendicularity. That is, it must
be assumed by both the <i>unodim</i> and the <i>duodim</i> that
the new dimension must lie in a plane perpendicular
to their space. So, the <i>unodim</i> would postulate that
the two-space must lie in a direction at right angles
to his space, and yet he would not be able to indicate
the direction owing to his ignorance of any experience
that would acquaint him with the new space as well
as the want of possibility of motion therein. Similarly,
the <i>duodim</i> would arrive at a conception of
three-space. Thus, it has been argued that <i>tridims</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
or people living in our tridimensional world, could,
by using a like line of argument or reasoning, arrive
at a conception or understanding of the four-space,
which, of course, must also lie in a direction at right
angles to three-space.</p>

<p>The implications of this mode of thought show
how thoroughly the mathematician recognizes the
limitations which consciousness imposes upon our
knowledge of the world and the subtler conditions
about us. But, moreover, it is even obvious to all who
stop to think about it; for it can readily be seen how
little those things which do not enter our scope of
awareness affect us either physically, mentally or spiritually.
But no one can be so bold as to deny utterly
that anything exists but what is found in our consciousnesses.
It is even true that in the great centers
of population where people are compelled to live many
families in the same house, it is the usual thing for
these individual families to live in complete forgetfulness
of all the others in the house and live their lives
so completely that it would be exceedingly difficult to
measure the effect the one has upon the other. The
mathematician, as is shown by the hyperspace movement,
recognizes that there are planes of superconsciousness
the nature and character of which persons
confined to limited areas of consciousness can have no
knowledge and may only arrive at that knowledge by
serious thought and contemplation. In other words,
they tacitly admit the existence of higher planes of
consciousness as well as the necessity of elevating the
personal consciousness in order to comprehend them.
Although it was not expressly allowable in the analogy
of the <i>unodim</i>, it is nevertheless one of the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
implications of the process of reasoning that the
<i>unodim</i> could have easily raised the plane of his consciousness
by continuing his researches until he, too,
became conscious of the three-space, mathematically,
as well as the two-space. For it was not necessary
for him to raise the plane of consciousness in order
to contact the two-space. He had need only to widen
it. But in order to comprehend the mathematical
three-space it would be necessary for him to elevate
his consciousness.</p>

<p>The fundamental error in the foregoing line of
thought rests in the fact that awareness in the human
family has not developed in the manner outlined.
The human species has not come into conscious relations
with the three-space by outgrowing the one-space
and the two-space in succession. The fact of the
matter is that when consciousness first dawned it must
have encompassed all three dimensions simultaneously
and equally and there is nothing to indicate that its
rise was otherwise. Then, specifically there is no
evidence that the evolution of consciousness has proceeded
in a rectangular manner. Indeed, there is undoubtedly
no warrant for the assumption that it has
progressed in ways that are mathematically determinable
at all. The question very naturally rises in view
of the above as to the relative value of mathematical
knowledge in the scheme of psychogenesis. Can
mathematical knowledge or laws be said actually and
finally to settle once for all time any question in which
consciousness or life enters as a factor? Upon the
response to this question hinges unanswerably the decision
as to the category which mathematical knowledge
should by right occupy in the entire schematism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of life. If it can be successfully maintained that final
judicative power abides in mathematics in the determination
of these questions, then it would be useless
to struggle against the fiat of mathematics and mathematicians;
verily, we should be compelled to accept
<i>nolens volens</i> all that mathematicians have devised
about hyperspace and its connotations. If, on the
other hand, it can be shown that no such judicative
power inheres in mathematical knowledge we shall
then be able to establish for mathematics a true category
and to dispose of the hyperspace movement in
a manner that shall at once be logical and necessary.</p>

<p>That the discovery of hyperspace by the mathematician
is merely an aspect of a general forward
movement in the evolution of consciousness can be
shown by a brief correlative study. Hyperspace is the
artificial symbol of a higher and more extensive realm
of awareness. For it cannot be doubted that to be
able to think in the terms of hyperspace, to study the
various relations and interrelations upspringing from
the original premises, actually to become conscious in
the hyperspatial realm thus constructed, requires a
different species or quality of consciousness than that
required for ordinary thinking. The period covering
the rise of artificial spatiality is contemporaneous with
the rise of the phenomena identified with the spiritual
life of <span class="smcap">Swedenborg</span>; for during the same time he
began a series of visions which revealed to him great
knowledge of the unseen and supersensuous realities
of life and existence. His consciousness was being
flooded with the light from so-called celestial spheres
and he was gradually becoming conscious of a "new
dimension," a new space, a higher world that is alto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>gether
unlike the world of the senses. During this
period, too, <span class="smcap">Dante</span>, the great kosmic seer began to
jot down the results of his "hyperspace" experiences,
after which he wrote his <i>Divina Commedia</i> in which
he describes more or less minutely some of the characteristics
of the hyperspace domain which was revealed
to his consciousness as he saw and interpreted
it. Both <span class="smcap">Swedenborg</span> and <span class="smcap">Dante</span> being deeply religious
and pious-minded had their reports of the new
world colored by their own mental experiences and
proclivities. <span class="smcap">Plato</span> had at an earlier day set down
what he conceived to be the ethical and civic characteristics
of the new age, the <i>Utopia</i> of mankind
living on a higher plane. It was during these days
that the doctrine of evolution was born, although it
remained for <span class="smcap">Darwin</span> to formulate and buttress it
with a stupendous congeries of facts. <span class="smcap">Martin
Luther</span>, the great religious reformer, likewise contacted
the radiating light-glow of a higher consciousness
into which the race was coming but of which
only the foremost were able to get advance glimpses.
<span class="smcap">Kant</span>, one of the peerless leaders of the vanguard
of humanity, at this time also, conceived and wrote
his <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> which is likewise an evidence
of the upliftment of his consciousness on the
side of pure intellectuality and the commencement of
a general period of illumination. And then, later,
but embraced within the same period, artists began
to get glimpses of this higher consciousness which
showed itself in a new and strange departure in art.
In rapid succession new schools sprang up and came
to be known as the "cubist," "post-impressionist,"
"futurist," "orphimist," the "synchromist" and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
"vorticist." Art really began the search for the
"plastic essence of the world" trying to portray its
conception of the "real image of the spirit" of the
world. Color acquired a new kind of splendor and
painting gave birth to a new intrinsic beauty of material
and sheer loveliness of texture. All of which
were evidences of an intellectual up-reaching in response
to the sharp appulsions from above. <span class="smcap">Darwin</span>'s
mind, being of scientific bent, saw and interpreted
everything in the terms of materialistic science; but
there is no doubt but that the expansion of the area
of awareness which his mind experienced in his great
conception of evolution as a continuous process and
all that it implies thereby was a result of the universal
appulsion of the human intellect against the new
domain of consciousness. And <span class="smcap">Kant</span>'s conception of
space in general perhaps may be said to have been the
seed-thought for the metageometrician.</p>

<p>But thus it will be noted that in all the cases mentioned
in the foregoing there is always present the
personal element of the investigator, and that the reports
of each of these have been colored and characterized
by their individual consciousness and experiences.
That all reports would agree with respect
to details connected with the new domain of consciousness
could scarcely be expected owing to the wonder
and bewilderment which seize the intellect under such
circumstances. No implication that the mathematicians
have been unduly excited by what they have discovered
after years of patient research in this direction
is indicated by the foregoing observations; but
it cannot be denied that the enthusiasm of the moment
and the consequent minimization of all other phenom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ena
but the special line being investigated serve very
effectively to obscure the mental vision of the more
partisan. It perhaps is sufficient that the investigator
should set down in as orderly manner as possible the
things which he conceives, and that he should interpret
them according to the standards of his own intellect.
More than this cannot be expected. Moreover, it
usually suffices that the future investigator, far removed
from the beclouding influences of partisanship,
who successfully raises his consciousness to that
higher plane shall be able to synthesize the findings
of all and thereby with the aid which comes to him
from a more advantageous position arrive at sounder
views and a more reliable judgment.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the metageometrician's
method of interpretation is no more entitled to final
credence and general acceptance than that of the
spiritualist, <span class="smcap">Swedenborg</span>, or the occult seer, <span class="smcap">Dante</span>.
For in their best moods and at their highest points
of mental efficiency these have only succeeded in
vaguely symbolizing what they have conceived of the
realities of the supersensuous realm in terms of their
own experiences. Is there any more cogent reason,
then, for accepting the analyst's conception of a world
of hyperspace peopled with ensembles, propositions,
spaces of <i>n</i>-dimensionality and other mathetic contrivances
than the <i>Inferno</i> of <span class="smcap">Dante</span>, inhabited by
hideous shapes and repellent denizens, the remains of
ill-spent earth-lives or <span class="smcap">Swedenborg's</span> <i>Celestial Realm</i>,
wherein dwell numerous beings of celestial character
performing various tasks in the work of the world?
These observations should not lead the reader to come
to the conclusion that the visions of <span class="smcap">Dante</span> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">swedenborg</span> are deemed to be more worthy of
credence than mathematical knowledge when that
knowledge is limited to the sphere where it rightfully
belongs; but the proper view is that which would make
it appear that it is the way these widely differing
workers interpret what they have seen; that it is the
adaptation of the unseen realms to the peculiarities
of the mentalities which observe them. The mathematicians
have simply portrayed as well as they could
their conception of the new stage of consciousness and
its contents, and following the <i>modus vivendi</i> of all
intellects have interpreted these things in the terms of
mathematics, merely because mathematics constituted
the best available symbology at hand for the purpose.
Similarly, the painter sees a new world of color; the
politician, a new era of political freedom; the religious
enthusiast, a new religious conception; the scientist, a
new condition of matter and energy, and so on, to
the most ordinary mind, each sees something new
while at the same time is necessarily limited to the
confines of his own mentality when he comes to interpret
what he sees and conceives. Hence, there
would appear to be only one way to regard all these
advances and that is by synthesizing them, by correlating,
and by tracing them to a common source, and
finally by seeing them as one general forward movement
of intellectual evolution.</p>

<p>Man, the Thinker, who in essence is a pure intelligence,
has two mental mechanisms or organs of
consciousness. One of these is the brain-consciousness
or the egoic. It is so called because the brain is its
organ of expression and impression. It manifests
through the brain and uses it to further the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
objective cognitive processes. The brain-consciousness
is a child of the physical body and its life is intimately
identified with the life of the body. This consciousness
may be called the <i>a posterioristic</i> mechanism or
organ of the Thinker and is therefore his means of
interpreting the phenomena of the objective world.
Cell-consciousness is a phase of the ergonic functions
of the <i>a posterioristic</i> mechanism. The other organ
of consciousness is an aspect of the intelligence of the
Thinker himself and perhaps may be said to be the
active, organized portion of that intelligence. It is
separate and distinct from the <i>a posterioristic</i> consciousness
yet sustaining a substructural relationship
with it, being the source of the egoic or brain-consciousness.
It may be called the <i>a priori</i> consciousness.
Its roots are buried deep within the heart of
the space-mind and it is therefrom nourished and developed
by what it receives in the way of intelligence.
It is the intuitional faculty; knows without being
taught; conceives without reason; interprets according
to the norms of the space-mind or the divine mind of
the kosmos. It always resides on a higher plane than
that of the brain-mind or consciousness, only at rare
intervals being able to contact it with flashes of its
own intelligence as intuitions.</p>

<p>The <i>a priori</i> consciousness being the intuitive
faculty of the Thinker is, therefore, a phase of his
mental life on a higher plane than the sensuous. All
its conceptions constitute the <i>a priori</i> knowledge of
the brain mind so-called. The <i>a priori</i> faculty of man's
higher consciousness gives the character possessed by
that form of knowledge known to philosophy as the
<i>a priori</i>. So that the <i>a priori</i> has a more substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
basis than has hitherto been surmised. It is not only
that which may be said to transcend experience but
that which is the organ of contact with the supersensuous
realities as well as of expression through the
brain-consciousness.</p>

<p>The mind's method of apprehending objective phenomena
is not a direct process but an indirect process by
virtue of which neurograms or nerve-impacts registered
in the brain are interpreted. External sense-impressions
are, of course, conveyed to the cortical area by means
of appropriate vibrations which traverse the lines of
the neural mechanism. These are recorded in the
brain areas just as a telegraphic communication is
registered in the apparatus of the receiving end, and
in being so, they make terminal registrations which
man, the Thinker, interprets after a psychic code which
has been built up empirically. That is, he comes to
know that certain rates of vibration and certain
peculiarities therein mean certain things when referred
to the sensorium. He then interprets according
to this experience the symbolism of all neurographical
impressions. But it is obvious that under
such circumstances, where the interpreter is far removed
from the thing itself and finds it necessary to
interpret rates of vibration or symbols in order to
arrive at a knowledge of the intelligence which is conveyed
to him, the chances of inadequate conception
are very great indeed. In fact, it is not possible
through the use of neurographical symbols alone to
get any complete notion of the phenomena considered.
And thus there stands between the Thinker and absolute
knowledge a barrier which prevents his arriving
at a state of certitude in his knowledge of the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of sensible objects. It is, however, a barrier which
will always remain, checking ever his approach to
finality in his understanding of the universum of appearances.</p>

<p>A markedly different condition obtains in the realm
of the <i>a priori</i> or intuitional for the reason that the
barriers which inhere in the neurographical or <i>a
posterioristic</i> method are absent and the Thinker has
a more direct approach to the objects of cognition.
Hence the chance for error is very small indeed. This
will account, therefore, for the superiority of the intuitional
over the rational or the perceptual. Indeed,
it is doubtful whether the purely rational possesses
any value whatsoever when its <i>modus vivendi</i> is unsanctioned
by the intuitional.</p>

<p>Else why can we not be certain that the results of
our rational processes are correct at all times? Is it
not because we lack the power to perceive whether
our premises are correct in the first place? Quite
truly. For if the Thinker can intuit the necessity and
certitude of any given premise it follows that the
consequences of that premise are true. It would,
therefore, appear that the more the intuitional faculty
is developed the clearer will be our perceptions not
alone of abstract values but of objective things themselves.
Further, it is doubtlessly true that the more
the space-mind is developed in the human race the
deeper will become our perceptions of the essential
<i>be-ness</i> of things so that whatever may be the presentations
of the space-mind to the brain-mind they will be
by far more accurate than the impressions we receive
through the latter as a medium of apprehension. It
is but natural, however, that in the present more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
less chaotic condition in which the faculty of the
intuitional is found it should be difficult even to interpret
its presentations accurately. It is perhaps due
to the fact that we are unused to its deliveries and
mode of registration as well as to the fact that it has
been overshadowed by the intellectual or rational
faculty. But the mere fact that it is present and functioning,
even if but rudimentarily, is evidence of its
potentiality and the possibility of its future development
to a still higher degree of efficiency.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the original impulse
which resulted in the creation of the faculty of perceptibility
in the Thinker also marked out the metes
and bounds of our entire range of perceivability which
includes not only the intuitional but something higher
still. There is no doubting either the obvious
fact that these metes and bounds cannot have been
other than rudimentary or general lines of denotation,
and that the work of their further elaboration and
refinement is a matter of evolutionary detail. For if
we assume that the general principles of evolution are
true we immediately recognize the cogency of this
view. That which we now call the hand has not
always been the perfect instrument that it is nor has
the ear always been so keenly adjusted as at present.
It has required undoubtedly many million of years
for the eye to reach its present degree of complexity
and adaptability. Yet in all these cases the different
organs existed in potentiality from the beginning; the
metes and bounds of the hand, the ear and the eye
were laid out primordially. Evolution has specialized
and adjusted them to environments and needs. Thus
it will be seen that while the intuitional faculty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
designed for manifestation from the beginning it has
nevertheless required ages for its appearance even in
the most rudimentary fashion.</p>

<p>Almost the entire content of human knowledge is
based upon assumptions or hypotheses; in fact, is but
a mass of these, and especially is this true of mathematics,
science and philosophy. Of course, there are
certain minor observable facts which by reason of the
seeming permanence of their existence have been
eliminated from the category of assumptions. But
even this elimination when it is traced to its depths
may be found to be erroneous, and perhaps after all,
when we have really begun to know something of the
reality of things, may have again to be placed in this
category. And then, too, the hypothetical nature of
our knowledge is due largely to the Thinker's method
of contacting the objective world which is the subject
of his knowledge. It is because it is necessary for him
to interpret the neurographical symbols which sense-impressions
make in the brain matter according to a
psychic code that renders his knowledge of things in
general hypothetical. His interpretations are based
upon an assumed value which experience has taught
him to give to each neurogram. But even when his
interpretations leave nothing to be desired in respect
to their accuracy of apprehension of what the neurographical
vibration implies there is that further barrier
to his cognition of reality which is due to his remote
removal from the object itself and the consequent
extreme difficulty, if not present impossibility, of
identifying his consciousness with the essence of the
objects which he contemplates.</p>

<p>When the Thinker's consciousness is presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
with a neurograph of say, a cube, it is not the cube
itself which he contemplates or observes; it is the
neurograph or psychic symbol which the sense-impressions
make in the brain. His consciousness deals not
with the object but with the symbols. It is true that
when he verifies one neurograph by another, as the
<i>scopographic</i> or sight impressions by the <i>tactographic</i>
or touch impressions it is found that the delivery thus
determined is a true enough representation. It is also
true that the Thinker, as a rule, does not accept a
neurograph as valid until it has been verified by at
least one or more presentations through his outer
sense organs. It occurs, therefore, that all such deliveries
are verified and corrected by one or more
sense witnesses before final acceptance by the Thinker;
but even then it cannot be said that his notions thus
gained are in all respects correct and true to the
standards set up by the brain-consciousness not to
mention higher forms of consciousness. And then,
when we consider that in addition to the numerous
chances for error which naturally inhere in this method
of cognition it must also be apparent that the Thinker's
approach to the reality of things is much impeded by
his separation therefrom, the unreliability of our
ordinary methods of cognition is much emphasized.</p>

<p>But aside from the egoic or brain-consciousness
there is the higher consciousness of the Thinker himself.
For the brain-consciousness is merely his method
of regarding and comprehending the neurographical
deliveries, the psychic code by which he systematizes
and organizes his cognitions or impressions of the
sensible world. This higher consciousness constitutes
the faculty <i>a priori</i> for the Thinker on a higher plane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of existence, and because it deals with elements altogether
unlike those which make up the data of brain-consciousness
is, accordingly, less liable to error in its
judgments of the supersensuous presentations than is
the objective or brain-mind. In fact, it is difficult to
conceive of a state or conditions wherein, supported
as this view contemplates, the intuition should err in
judgment. Viewed from the standpoint of external
impedimenta, this condition may be said to be due to
the absence of sensuous barriers which would otherwise
prevent the near approach of the Thinker's consciousness
to the essence of things which is the object
of his consciousness on this higher plane. Directly,
however, it is undoubtedly due to the fact that, following
the lead of life itself, yea, as the veritable handmaid
of life, it cannot err where life is concerned.
When dealing with notions <i>a priori</i> or intuitograms
the Thinker is relieved of the onerous necessities and
limitations incident to the examination and determination
of neurographic symbols registered in the brain
cortex and so is free to study, to examine and judge
at first hand the impressions which are received from
his own plane of intuition. The difference is about the
same as that which should exist between the methods
of communication between two telegraphic operators
when in one instance they would have to depend upon
the deliveries conveyed over the wires, while in the
other, when they stood face to face with each other,
they could communicate by direct conversation. In the
one case the method of communication is direct and
simple, while in the other it is indirect, circuitous and
complex. It can, therefore, be readily seen that in
all cases where the approach is made in a direct, simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
manner the probability of error is much less than in
cases where the intellectual approach is less direct and
more complicated. Hence in drawing conclusions as
to the relative importance of the two mechanisms of
consciousness, the <i>a posterioristic</i> and the <i>a priori</i>, it
is necessary to bear in mind the comparative superiority
of the one over the other as a means of cognition.
It matters little that the intuitional faculty is not so
well developed as the tuitional because it is but natural
that inasmuch as the Thinker's needs are subserved
in the sensuous realm by the tuitional consciousness it
should, from more active use, gain somewhat over
the intuitional in facility of expression and general
utility. And the more so, because the two faculties
serve different purposes; one is attuned to receive impressions
from a subtler plane while the other is fitted
for contact with the phenomenal universe; one is related
to the conceptual while the other is related to
the perceptual. They differ not only in function, but
in nature as well. There is, of course, a natural barrier
consisting of the inherent limitations of each
faculty which prevents the full mergence or unification
of the two states of consciousness so that there exists
a state of consciousness the data of which the brain-mind
is unaware, it being able only at rare intervals
even to receive so much as slight impressions from it
in the nature of intuitional flashes or inspirations and
the like. Viewed in this light it would appear that
the cognitions which are most truthworthy are those
which are presented by the intuitional faculty because
they are nearer to the essential reality of things; they
have to do more specifically with the nature of that
which <i>appears</i> while the tuitional mind can only regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
that which is the appearance. Herein lies the whole
difference.</p>

<p>The natural outcome of this division of labor between
the tuitional and the intuitional is the establishment
of the fact of man's relationship both to the
phenomenal and the real; that in his psychic nature
must reside the faculty of apprehending the real and
that he shall one day awaken into activity this now
latent faculty whereby he may make a direct and naked
contact with reality.</p>

<p>If it be true that, as <span class="smcap">Plato</span> said, God does
geometrize, and that the divine geometry, as will appear,
is based upon a system, an alphabet which taken
together are the point . , the line &mdash;&mdash;, <img src="images/triangle.jpg" alt="Triangle" title="Triangle"></img>, the square
    <img src="images/square.jpg" alt="Square" title="Square"></img>, and the circle
    <img src="images/circle.jpg" alt="circle" title="circle"></img>, then,
we have in this geometric alphabet the very secret of
the divine geometry. With these, and in the kosmic
laboratory of <i>chaogeny</i>, the Creative Logos has
measured off the limits and confines of space; with
them He has traced out its dimensions the archeological
evidences of which we may view in the space-mind
itself; and with them he has established the
manner of its appearance to the Thinker. In dimensions,
three, and yet not three, but one, Space, the
eternal progenitor of all forms and energies, having
received the divine fiat in the beginning that thus far
it should extend and no further, persists in faithful
obedience to the law of its being&mdash;tridimensionality.
It must be so because it is thus sanctioned by the highest
faculty in man that can render judgment thereon.
If tridimensionality inhere in the space-mind, as the
law of its being and in the intuitional consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
as the norm of its essential nature and as the easiest
and simplest expression of the tuitional mind, how can
it be gainsaid that these considerations obviate the
necessity of the mathetical hyperspace?</p>

<p>If the reality of things is hidden from us and if
we are, therefore, unable to perceive their real essences
it is because our mode of thought and our consciousness
have obscured our vision and limited us to this
state of paucity of perception. It is not because reality
is itself a hidden, inscrutable quantity nor that its
<i>modus vivendi</i> is "unknowable"; but because we being
multiformly limited, "cabined, cribbed and confined"
are resultantly lacking in the power to discern
that which otherwise would be most obvious to us. It
may well be set down as axiomatic that when, in the
process of our thinking, we arrive at the inscrutable,
the unknowable and the infinite, it is evident that our
thought processes are dealing with a form of realism
which is higher and beyond the possibilities of our
loftiest thought-reaches. And in order to symbolize
to itself this condition the intellect poses such terms as
"inscrutable," "unknowable" and the "infinite" simply
because that is the best it can do. Hence when it is
said that space is infinite it is apparent that the mind
recognizes that when it contemplates space it is dealing
with something whose degree of realism transcends
its powers of comprehension. Infinity is a relative
term, and in fact, decreases in extensity in the proportion
that the consciousness expands and comprehends.
It is not unlikely that should the intellect one day
discover that it had awakened into union with the
space-mind it would immediately reject its preconceived
notion of the infinity of space. But we need not wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
until the coming of this far off event in the path of
psychogenesis; for we can here and now perceive with
what must be a higher faculty than the intellect the
verity of this conclusion.</p>

<p>But certain it is that the intellect, in the pride and
arrogance of its traditional heritage, will not without
a great struggle yield the ground and prestige it has
held for an aeon of time; and in vain does the intuition
serve notice of dispossessal in these premises; but
however stubbornly fought the battle, however tenaciously
held the position time will discover the weakening
of the intellect's hand. Death for the intellect
may ensue as a result of the conflict but it will be a death
wherefrom it will arise, quickened, revivified and uplifted
by its disposer, the intuition, upon the remains
of its dead self to a higher and grander state than it
has ever enjoyed before.</p>

<p>Space is not static. It is dynamic, potential and
kinetic. It is a process, a becoming. Its duration as
a process is never ending. Its extensity is limited and
finite. The so-called infinity of space is one of the capital
illusions of the intellect which can only be removed
by an expansion of the consciousness, by a mergence
of the individual consciousness with the space-consciousness.
In the ever-widening circle of the individual
consciousness lesser realities give way to greater
as the darkness recedes from the light&mdash;the lesser
appearing in comparison with the greater, as the consciousness
broadens, as matter to spirit, as night to
day or as limitation to non-limitation. Thus the most
solid facts and conditions of our limited life are but
the shadows of the deeper realities which shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
revealed to the Thinker in the days of his larger and
more glorious life of freedom from limitations.</p>

<p>And now it will appear that the whole fabric of
our knowledge shall have to be reduced to the bare
warp and woof; for nothing is real but these. It
is as if the Thinker, using the tuitional mind, had
been in all times past studying the design woven
in the surface of a very thick plush carpet. There
are the warp and woof, the long vertical threads
which make the plush and the intricate design
appearing on the surface. Our knowledge may be
likened to the design. It represents the contents of
our knowledge. We have not even so much as begun
the study of the nature of the vertical threads as they
appear beneath the surface to say nothing of beginning
the study of the warp and woof. The warp and
the woof are the realism of the kosmos; the vertical
threads are the roots and stem of the phenomenal
world; the design is our sensible world as it appears
to the intellect. The life of the intellect has been
spent in contemplating this design; while of the hands
which wove the carpet, of the mind which directed
the hands and of the spirit which vitalized all, it knows
nothing nor indeed can it know anything. Where shall
we say are those hands, that mind and that spirit
which made the carpet possible and an actuality? In
vain do we search among the remains, among the soft,
glistening threads of the carpet or among the intricacies
of the design. For they are not there. They
have passed on. The intellect looks at the design or
at the vertical threads and because it is unable to follow
them to their source, it decides that they are infinite,
inscrutable and unknowable. But not so. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that is required are eyes to see and a mind (or shall
we say a mind vitalized by the intuition) trained to
discern the threads as they point upward with their
termini firmly rooted in the warp and woof of the
fabric. But we must first master the design, and then
turning to the threads, master them. Then shall the
doors of kosmic reality swing wide and the Thinker
shall be ushered into the eternal palace of kosmic
realism wherein he shall find the great secret, the
heart, the purpose, the beginning and the end, the very
nature of things-in-themselves.</p>

<p>The nature of every degree or condition of realism
is so constituted that its qualities, characteristics
and limitations are exactly adequate for the satisfaction
and fulfillment of all the requirements and needs
of every possible state of normal consciousness. So
that each degree of reality and each state of normal
consciousness is sufficient and complete in itself and
mutually satisfies the necessities of each other. The
substratum of reality or life which extends from the
heart of the kosmos to the extreme limits of the phenomenal
universe exists in degrees, not discrete, but
continuous. And these merge into one another by insensible
stages. Such is the imperceptible continuity
of the whole as each degree is gradually immerged
into the other that only the limitations of consciousness
itself make it to appear as if it were discontinuous.
For every stage of realism there is a state of consciousness
which answers to it completely and sufficiently.
So both the state of consciousness and that
of reality, manifesting at any given stage, seem to
be complete and final for that stage. Realism or life
and consciousness possess only a relative finality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
fashioned upon the necessities and requirements for
any given state of being. Consciousness alone fixes
the apparent limits of life; it also determines the state
of our knowledge of life. And thus when the Thinker
is confined to any stage of reality and congruent degree
of consciousness it appears that what he there finds
is ample for all his purposes. Accordingly he is convinced
that that stage is the final consideration of
his scope of motility. It is only when he is able to
raise his consciousness to a point where he can contact
higher realities that he becomes aware that there are
higher stages in which his consciousness may manifest.
This peculiarity of the Thinker's consciousness is accentuated
when he allows himself to become wholly
engrossed with a study of the phenomena of that stage
in which he can consciously function. Hence it constantly
occurs that men exhausting the study of the
phenomenal find themselves floundering upon the beach
of the outlying shores of consciousness where in sheer
desperation they fall into the illusion that they have
indeed reached the limits of manifested life and that
beyond those limits there is no organized being. Unconscious
are they that in ever widening circles the
fertile lands extend and await the awakening of their
consciousness when they may till the fallow ground
of this new domain and begin again the search for the
ultimately real.</p>

<p>With respect to the present powers of consciousness,
it cannot be successfully controverted that the
concept of tridimensionality of space is sufficient for
all purposes. It must be so for it is not only an aspect
of the phenomena of space but of reality as well. This
fact is attested by the nature of mind that answers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to the nature of space. Tridimensionality characterizes
the entire extent of consciousness and life, and
therefore, of space itself. This characterization may be
traced to the very doors of the heart of space where the
three become one. Nor would this conception be in
the least vitiated if it were allowed that the mass of the
phenomena of the supersensuous world, lying in close
proximity to the sensuous world, does present itself
to the consciousness in a four-dimensional manner and
that the phenomena of a still higher plane present themselves
in a five or <i>n</i>-dimensional manner to that state of
consciousness which may be congruent with them; because
then we should be making allowances for the
changes in phenomena and their mode of presentation
to the consciousness which by no means implies a corresponding
change in reality or life. All phenomena
are fashioned by the intellect. The phenomenal world
is just what the intellect interprets it to be. It is that
and nothing more. Its qualities, attributes and characteristics
are such as the consciousness gives to it. It
exists only for the purposes of the evolving consciousness.
And, as an instrument of consciousness, its existence
is strictly subject to the evolutionary needs
thereof. In that moment that the immediate needs
of the consciousness shall no longer be able to find
satisfaction in the phenomena of any plane of nature,
in that moment the phenomena of that plane disappear,
recede and are swallowed up in the maelstrom
of eternal reality.</p>

<p>In the gradual expansion of consciousness as it
passes through the infinite series of grades of awareness
meantime becoming deeper, broader and more
comprehensive as it proceeds, there may be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
running through all these planes and orders that which
is neither the phenomena of the various planes nor
the consciousness; but which must be the substructural
basis of both, remaining the same, unchanged and unchangeable.
That is the thread of reality, the passage
of life itself which is the eternal basis of all. Now
it is to this reality, life, that the space-mind is related
and in which its roots, its heart and the very center
of its being are at one with the divine mind of the
kosmos.</p>

<p>The question of dimensionality is solely a concern
of the objective or brain-mind which is the intellect.
It is one of the ways in which the intellect endeavors
to understand phenomena. It is an arbitrary contrivance
devised by the intellect for its convenience in
studying the world of things. Without it, as obviously
appears, the intellect would not be able to go
very far in its consideration of the minor problems
which inhere in material things. The fourth dimension
is but another attitude, another contrivance, which
the intellect has devised in order that it may study
from another angle the evanescent phenomena of the
world of appearances. Having apparently exhausted
the possibilities of motion in three dimensions, and
being driven on to the acquirement of more picturesque
views by the very necessity of its continued growth, it
has betaken itself to another higher mountain peak,
called "hyperspace" where with larger lenses and
higher powered instruments it is beginning to scan
the landscapes of a new intellectual realm of consciousness.
Yet the celestial wonders of this new-found
realm of consciousness remain in undisturbed forgetfulness
or neglect. But it is not by a scrutiny of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
mathetic landscapes nor by a study of the celestial
wonders that the Thinker shall one day realize the
object of his eagerly pushed quest after the real; for
he shall find it, if at all, in the temple of the kosmic
mind which is not made by the intellect nor meted and
bounded by geometric systems of space-measurement.</p>

<p>In all the learned pother incident to the mastery
of the phenomenal, the furniture of the world of the
senses, it is as if the self in man, the Thinker, sat
secluded in a six-walled tenement, and hence six times
removed from the subject of his study, and endeavored
to interpret that which appeared to his vision. And
thus, thinking that what he sees is the only reality,
he remains in inglorious nescience of the reality of
that upon which he himself stands, unconscious that the
tunnel-shaped aperture through which he peers leads not
outward, but <i>backward</i> and within to the habitation
of the real of which he himself is a part. Men are
deeply and well-nigh hopelessly concerned with appearances,
with static views of life, with instantaneous
exposures. Life, reality and all the eternal verities
pass on and assume countless postures, attitudes,
moods, tenses and nuances. The intellect is content
to occupy itself with a single tense or mood. Indeed,
it has no aptitude or power to consider more than one
at a single time. It thus misses the continuity, the
ceaselessness, of life. What is more, every singularity,
every attitude, mood or tense which the intellect
grasps for consideration is immediately remade
so as to fit its own moods and tenses. And upon each
and every nuance the intellect immediately imposes
its own form&mdash;actually and literally rehabilitates them
with its own habiliments. Unfortunately, this pecul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>iarity
occludes the intellect from any approach to the
true nature of that phase which it can grasp.</p>

<p>Hyperspace is one of the illusions of the phenomenal;
it is the dress which the intellect has superimposed
upon a single nuance; it is a mask which is
an exact replica of the mood of the intellect. Yet
through this mask the intellect grandly hopes to approach
reality. The period through which the mind
is now passing is a repetition of the evil days of
scholasticism when men set out to determine the exact
number of celestial beings that could be perched upon
the extremity of a needle point. It is a time when
men's minds easily assume grotesque and hideous
shapes and their thoughts become the embodiment of
fantastic entities. The exclusive occupation of such
minds becomes the fabrication of mathetic monstrosities
which rapidly deliquesce upon the first approach
of the real or the appearance of the first ray of intuition
which may escape through the dim and misty condition
of the intellectual over-hangings. It will not be
ever thus; for the Thinker will one day pass from a
study of the arrangement of phenomena in space and
by well-ordered steps come once again to himself.
And then through the maze of it all set out upon the
true path&mdash;&mdash;the tridimensionality of space following
which he will inevitably approach the citadel of the
real, the kosmic space-mind.</p>

<p>Geometry is concerned primarily with a study of
the measurement of magnitudes in space. Three coördinates
are necessary and sufficient for all of its
determinations. Metageometry comprehends the
study of the measurement of magnitudes in conceptual
space. For its purposes four or <i>n</i>-coördinates are
necessary and sufficient. Perceptual space is that form
of extension in which the physical universe is recognized
to have been created and in which it now exists.
Conceptual space is an idealized conception belonging
to the domain of mathesis and has no actual, physical
existence outside of the mind. Mathematical space
represents the idealism of perceptual space.</p>

<p>Geometrical magnitudes may be defined as symbols
of physical objects and geometry as a treatise on the
symbology of forms in space. In fact, all cognitive
processes are simply efforts at interpreting the sym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>bolism
of sense-deliveries; and the difference between
mere knowledge and wisdom, which is the essence of
all knowledge, is the difference between the understanding
of a symbol and the comprehension of the
essential nature of the thing symbolized. So long as
knowledge of space is limited to the understanding of
a symbol or symbols by which it is presented to the
consciousness so long will it fall short of the comprehension
of the essential nature of space. In vain have
we sought in times past to understand space by
studying relations, positions and the characteristics of
forms in space; in vain have we based our conclusions
as to its real nature upon the fragmentary evidences
which our senses present to our consciousnesses. It is
as if one had busied himself with one of the meshes in
a great net and confined his entire attention to what
he found there, meanwhile remaining in complete ignorance
of the nature of the net, how it came to be
there, of what it is made and how great its extent
may be.</p>

<p>There is ever a marked difference between a symbol
and the thing which it symbolizes. Words are the
symbols of ideas; ideas, as they exist in the mind, are
the symbols of eternal verities as they exist in the consciousness
of the Logos of the universe. There may
be a wide diversity of symbolic forms which represent
one single idea; as, for instance, the variety of word
forms which represent the idea of deity in the various
languages. Likewise there may be a multiplicity of
ideas which represent a single verity. But neither is
the idea nor the word the real thing in itself. That
quality of a life-aspect which we call its <i>thingness</i> has
an essential nature which cannot become the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of consciousness except by virtue of its representation
through ideas and their symbolisms, and even
then, the thing which we conceive is not the nature
of a quality of the life-aspect but an idea of it&mdash;a
symbol which stands for that idea. In order, therefore,
for the mind to arrive at an understanding of
an eternal verity, such as space, it must first be able
to synthesize all of the representative ideas and then
abstract from their compositeness a notion of its
essential nature. But this can be done only by identifying
the consciousness with the essential being of the
object considered. In other words, the consciousness
and the intrinsic being of forms, principles, forces and
processes must embrace each other in the intimacies
of direct cognition; the life which is consciousness and
that life which is essential being, being coeval, coördinate
and mutually responsive, must in so close a
contact as here intimated reach an understanding of
the realism shared by both. That is, the human consciousness,
following in the wake of life and consisting
of a specialized aspect of life itself, will, by such an
intimate approach to the life-principle of forms,
readily understand; for it has only to recognize a
replica of itself in rendering its judgment. But it is
not claimed that such a state of recognition by the
consciousness of life itself can be attained at all by
ordinary means, neither is it believed that it is the
next stage in conscious evolution. However, it is not
doubted but that such an exaltation of the consciousness
is possible, yea practical; but the difficulties which
beset the path of attainment in this direction are so
great that it may as well be considered unattainable.
The mere fact of these difficulties, however, only re-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>emphasizes
the insufficiency of the intellectual method.
The identification of consciousness with essential being
is a procedure which cannot be accomplished by an
act of will directly and immediately. Because it is
a process, a series of unfoldments, an adjustment of
the focus of consciousness to the kosmic essentialities
which constitute the substructure of the manifested
universe. In the very nature of things, a kosmic
essentiality cannot be viewed as being in manifestation
especially in the same degree as ordinary physical
objects are manifest. The former is a state, a potentiality,
a dynamic force, an existence which should be
thought of as an extra-kosmic affair dwelling on the
plane of unity or kosmic origins; while the latter are
the exact opposite of this. The one can be seen, felt
and sensed while the other is the roots which are not
seen but lie buried deeply in the heart of the universal
plasm of being and beyond the ken of sensuous
apperception. The term <i>manifestation</i> is both relative
and flexible in its use. It is relative because it
will apply equally to all stages of cognition. A thing
is in manifestation when it is presentable to the
ordinary means of cognition belonging to any stage
of conscious functioning; it is not in manifestation when
it is beyond the scope of the Thinker's schematism
of cognitive powers. Its flexibility is seen in its ready
yieldance to the entire range of implications inhering
in the process of cognition, fitting the simplest as well
as the highest and most complex.</p>

<p>Great is the gulf which is interposed between
manifestation and non-manifestation; and yet the two,
in essence, are one. They are linked together as the
stem of a flower is joined to its roots. Likewise one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
is visible, palpable while the other is invisible, impalpable
though no less real and abiding. As the thin
crust of earth separates the stem, leaves and flowers
from the roots so the limitations of man's consciousness
separate the manifest from the unmanifest.
Similarly, as when the surrounding earth is removed
from the roots and they are laid bare revealing their
continuity and unity with the outputting stem and
flowers, so, when the limitations of consciousness are
removed by the subtle process of expansion to which
the consciousness is amenable so that it can encompass
the erstwhile unmanifest, it, too, will reveal the eternal
unity of the kosmic polars&mdash;manifestation and unmanifestation.</p>

<p>There is but one barrier to ultimate knowledge and
that is the human consciousness however paradoxical
this may seem. The unutterable darkness which shuts
out the so-called "unknowable" from our cognition
is the limitation of man's upreaching consciousness.
These limitations constitute the difference between the
human intellect and the mind of the Logos. Nevertheless
the outlying frontiers of man's consciousness
gradually are being pushed farther and farther without.
Every new idea gained, each new emotion indulged,
each new conception conquered, and every
mental foray which the Thinker makes into the realm
of the conceptual, every exploration into the abysmal
labyrinth of man's inner nature are the self's
expeditionary forces which are gradually annihilating
the frontier barriers of consciousness and thus approaching
more closely upon the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of
man's spiritual possibilities.</p>

<p>Space is in manifestation. It exists and has being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
whether it is viewed as an object, an entity or the
mere possibility of motion. That it offers an opportunity
of motion and renders it possible for objects
to move freely from point to point cannot be denied
and yet this fact has no bearing whatever upon the
essential nature of space. The very fact of its appearance,
its manifestation, makes it obvious that it
is the nether pole of that eternal pair of opposites&mdash;manifestation
and non-manifestation, being and non-being,
which are essentially one.</p>

<p>It will be seen from figure 17 that the period
of involution embraces seven separate stages, the
<i>monopyknon</i>, <i>duopyknon</i>, <i>tripyknon</i>, etc., being the
unit principle or engendering elements of the respective
stages. Involution comprises all creative activity from
the first faint stirrings of the void and formless chaos
until the universe has actually become manifest and
dense physical matter has appeared. It is divided
into two cardinal periods, namely, the chaogenic
period during which primordial chaos is given its
character and directive tendencies for the world age.
It is a phase of duration wherein the fiat of kosmic
order is promulgated, and consist of three stages,
monopyknosis, duopyknosis, tripyknosis<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> gradually,
insensibly, gradating into the fourth or <i>quartopyknotic</i>;
the chaomorphogenic period is likewise divided
into three stages&mdash;<i>quintopkynosis</i>, <i>sextopyknosis</i> and
<i>septopyknosis</i>, developing out of the fourth gradually.
The quartopyknotic stage is the stage of metamorphosis
or transmutation wherein the transition
from non-manifestation to manifestation is completed;
it is also the stage of kosmic causation, because from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
it spring the matured causes or "vital impetus" which
engender all that follow.</p>

     <img src="images/fig17.jpg" alt=""></img>
 <br />
  <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Involution and Evolution</span>
</div>

<p>The close of the involutionary phase of the world
age is marked by the final deposition of dense physical
matter and this is closely followed by the beginnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of the evolutionary movement which, like the involutionary
movement, is divided into two cardinal periods,
namely, the morphogenic (during which are produced,
in turn, insensible forms, sensible forms and
spiritual forms) and the kathekotic period which
marks the perfection, the consummation of the evolutionary
movement. These two cardinal periods of
the evolutionary phase of duration and the two cardinal
periods of the involutionary phase complete the kosmic
age, the "Great Day of Brahma." The concentric
circles, beginning with the dot and ending with the
seven concentric circles, and designated as a, b, c, d,
e, f, g, are representations of the constitution of the
respective units corresponding to each of the seven
subdivisions. They symbolize the seven degrees of
condensation or pyknosis which comprise the genesis
of space, on the one hand, and on the other, the stages
of unfoldment. Because, during involution all potencies,
powers and characters were being infolded, involved;
but during evolution, these are being unfolded,
expressed, evolved.</p>

<p>The figure 18 is another view of these two major
movements, involution and evolution. The genesis of
space is here shown symbolized by the Kosmic Egg.
The seven stages of involution are referred to as, the
monopyknotic, duopyknotic, tripyknotic, quartopyknotic,
quintopyknotic, sextopyknotic and the septopyknotic;
while the corresponding stages of evolution are
referred to as, the physical, the sentient, mental,
causative or spiritual, the triadic, duadic and monadic,
indicating that the principle of physicality is succeeded
by the principles of sentience, mentality, spirituality,
and the three forms of kathekotic being. This sym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>bolism,
it should be stated, is designed with respect to
the universe and man and has no reference to other
possible evolutions than the human and contemporaneous
animal, plant and mineral evolutions.</p>

<p>To follow the ramifications of the symbolism
above would involve a survey of all branches of
knowledge, and indeed, would be out of place in this
book. Only the widest general outlines can be suggested
here and it is believed that this is sufficient to
enable the reader to grasp the magnitude of the
symbol and to understand its purpose and intent.</p>

<p>It would appear, therefore, that if it is possible for
the intellect to traverse by means of a study of kosmic
symbolism, used as a standard of reference, the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
length of the bridge which engages the antipodes into
an eternal unity, something may be gained in the way
of a more definite and clearer understanding of the
essential nature of space in its relation to kosmogenesis.</p>

<p>In the diagram, figure 17, is shown a table which
represents the stages of space-genesis. It will be noted
that the whole scheme is divided into seven stages.
It is not an arbitrary division simply but a symbolic
one and represents fullness, completeness, entirety.
The names given, namely, "monopyknotic, duopyknotic,"
etc., represent the symbolic characteristics of
each stage in its relation to the universe in the process
of becoming. The terms "monadic," "duadic," "triadic,"
etc., are representative of the seven planes of
matter in the universe.</p>

<p>A <i>pyknon</i> is a kosmic principle and represents the
typal aspect of kosmogenesis. It is a generic term
and may be identified in its relation to the various
stages by the prefix. The monopyknon belongs to the
ulterior pole of the antipodes on the side of non-manifestation.
So do the <i>duopyknon</i> and the <i>tripyknon</i>.
Pyknosis is a process of kosmic condensation,
or limitation for purposes of manifestation. It is a
stage in the descent of the kosmic Spirit-Life, a degradation
of non-manifestation into manifestation, and is,
therefore, the cardinal causative principle of creation.
The term pyknon being generic is applicable alike to
a particle of matter, a state of being, a condition of
existence, a process or a principle. The <i>monopyknon</i>
is, accordingly, the primary aspect of the process of
kosmic pyknosis. It is the archetype and therefore
all inclusive and omnipotential. But whether regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
as a singularity or as a whole it should never be
divorced in thought from the primal act of creation.
It represents the first act of material differentiation
in the being of the creative Logos on the plane of
non-manifestation. It is the beginning of every great
planetary or kosmic <i>manvantara</i> or period of manifestation.
During either a planetary, solar or kosmic
<i>pralaya</i>, or gestatory period, the kosmic plasm is in
a quiescent, undifferentiated condition. This undifferentiated
plasm when acted upon by the will of the
Creative Logos, <i>Fohat</i>, as He is sometimes called
in Eastern Philosophies, begins to become conditioned,
begins to differentiate. The primal act or stage in
such a process is the formation or appearance of a
monopyknon. It then becomes the characteristic
aspect of that stage.</p>

<p>Monopyknons are the quiescent, unawakened,
though potential and archetypal principles peculiar to
the monopyknotic period of space-genesis which are
ultimately to become, on the physical plane, singularities
of life of whatsoever kind. <i>Thus the lineage
of every single life-form or principle in the universe
runs unbroken back from the present of the Now to
the present of monopyknosis. So great is the design
of the kosmos that the entity which is now man or
the atom was started on its journey to this culmination
at the break of the Great Kosmic Day when the
omni-pregnant wheels of monopyknosis first began to
turn.</i> Duopyknons and tripyknons constitute the two
remaining stages on the plane of non-manifestation.
And their correspondences in every stage of involution
or the descent of spirit into matter are eternal and
kosmic. Likewise the lineage of the dual and triple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
aspects of all life forms on the path of evolution may
be traced rearward to the duopyknotic and tripyknotic
stages of kosmogenesis.</p>

<p>The metamorphosis by which the monopyknon becomes
a duopyknon contrives the differentiation of the
pristine plasm of kosmic being so that the first becomes
the ensouling or vitalizing principle of the second;
and, in turn, the second becomes the vitalizing or
inner principle of the third; the third of the fourth
and the fourth of the fifth and so on throughout the
series until the last is reached which is the <i>septopyknon</i>.
The septopyknon is, therefore, a seven-principled
form. It is both unitary and septenary&mdash;unitary
in the sense that the seven are really one and
septenary for the reason that each of the seven
principles, in the course of evolution, becomes a separate
process specially adapted to functioning upon its
peculiar plane of matter. Thus it is seen that the
utmost significance attaches to this septenary pyknosis
of the kosmic plasm of life. The implications of
this conception are, of course, too vast and multifarious
to be set down here. We shall have to dismiss
it with one observation only, and that is: <i>every
single appearance of life and form in the totality of
such appearances is rooted in kosmic pyknosis where
it has received its inner vitalizing force, its form and
the law of its mode and manner of appearance together
with the metes and bounds of its existence</i>.</p>

<p>These processes, monopyknosis and duopyknosis,
are to be regarded as taking place, each in its own
period, everywhere throughout the Body of Being of
the Logos but on the plane of non-manifestation.
They are states of preparation for manifestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
analogous to the germinative period of the seed or
the egg. They represent the first stirrings of the
kosmic plasm and contain the promise and potency
of all that is to succeed them. There is one other
stage, coördinate with these two, and that is the
tripyknotic which completes the unmanifest trinity and
constitutes the archetypal vehicle whence proceeds the
manifested universe. The ensouling principle of the
tripyknon is the duopyknotic principle. But when the
descent has reached the tripyknotic stage the three
have been merged into one and the characteristics
which were peculiar to each as a separate pyknon are
then fused into a single quality having three aspects
which are mutually interdependent and coördinate.</p>

<p>The unmanifest trinity, now complete as a result
of the triple pyknotic process, is the imperishable and
ever sustaining radix, the all-mother of the manifested
universe. It is the Golden Egg laid by the god <i>Seb</i>
at the beginning of a great life-cycle. It is also
<i>Chaos-Theos-Kosmos</i>, i.e., kosmic disorder, divine will
or generating element, and kosmic order or space.
In it, as in an egg, resides in kosmic potency all that
the universe is to become in any "Great Day of
Brahma" or any Great Kosmic Life Cycle. Its eldest
born is <span class="smcap">SPACE</span>, physiological and perceptual, and the
latter is the eternal father-mother of the universe.
<i>Space is, therefore, the male-female principle of
manifestation; in its kosmic womb all forms are
created, developed, evolved and sustained.</i> Into it
again, at the close of the Great Day, all existences,
forms and all principles matured and ripened by the
vicissitudes of kosmic evolution will be inhaled with
the return of the Great Breath of Life. The un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>manifest
trinity is the archetype, and therefore, the
pattern or model for the manifest, embodying in
potency all that the manifest may ever become. Forth
from the unmanifest proceeds space as a dynamic
process endued with the potentiality for generating
all that the manifested universe contains.</p>

<p>The terms "unmanifest," "unconditioned" and
"unlimited" have a special meaning here and are used
in the same sense as the mathematical term "transfinite,"
and therefore, imply a transcending of any
finite or assignable degree or quality of manifestation.
Hence they should be distinguished from the term
"absolute" which has a different implication. So that
although the triple process outlined above may not
be viewed except as a characterization of the plane
of non-manifestation, and hence of the primordial
activity of the Creative Logos, there is nothing in the
symbolism to warrant the identification of this process
in any way with the Logos in absolution. For on this
view Absolute Being is, in a large measure, sacrificed
when the monopyknotic process is begun and the
monopyknon (kosmic principle) begins to appear.
Absolute Being, while it may not be defined, delineated
or described may be symbolized by the ideograph:
"action in inaction"; "being in non-being"; "manifestation
in non-manifestation"; for these are symbols
merely and do not describe or delineate.</p>

<p>We have observed the subtle connection which
exists between manifestation and non-manifestation
and have seen how that, as the roots of a plant sustain
the outer growth of stem and flowers, the former
being the matrix out of which proceeds the latter, and
that in like manner does the unmanifest sustain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
manifest; it should, therefore, be clear that the Body
of Being of the Unmanifest Logos, in a similar
manner, is the basis and cause of all that is manifest
or in existence; <i>and yet it is more, it is essentially all
that is and all that the all is to be in manifestation at
any time throughout the immeasurable process of
kosmogenesis</i>. <i>It is the Self of the Universe, the
meta-self of the great diversity of selves.</i> The Self,
however, although it cannot be said to exist except as
a simple, homogeneous quantity is nevertheless, in the
very nature of things, a triunity, and in essence, not
only the basal element of the All-Space and the concrete
forms which exist therein, but is also identical
in essence and substance with space.</p>

<p>A stage has now been reached in the description
of our symbolism when it may be assumed, upon the
basis of the foregoing, that the meta-self has become
manifest, i.e., in potential and dynamic appearance,
as a result of the triple process of pyknosis hereinbefore
outlined. The meta-self may then be identified
with the Supreme Manifest Deity; for there is ever
a subtle identification of the manifest with the unmanifest.
Out of their action and interaction the universe
is made manifest and phenomenal and is thereby sustained.
The reciprocity of action between these two
kosmic polars, is the metamorphotic key to creation;
it is the symbol of the procedure of Creative Will in
the act of creating. It is the transitional process
whereby the passage is made from non-being to being;
from the unconditioned to the conditioned; from undifferentiation
to differentiation and is reflected and
symbolized in every natural process wherein matter
is transformed from one state to another, or life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
mind and spirit diffused, centralized and organized into
ever new and higher forms and expressions.</p>

<p>Another important notion to be gained in this
connection is the fact that it appears as a logical
sequence to the foregoing that the being of the manifested
Logos must necessarily fill all space, yea more,
is that space in every conceivable essentiality. His
limitations are the limitations of space. His qualities,
properties and attributes are the qualities, properties
and attributes of space and are only different from the
original spatial character when manifested through a
diversity of forms by whose very inner constitution and
exterior form the modifications are accomplished. <i>All
matter in the universe, all energy, and indeed, all
manifestations or emanations of whatsoever character,
hue, tone or quality are, in reality, His being and
nothing but His being. There is, therefore, no form
nor ensouling principle whether of life, mind or sheer
dynamism which can exist outside of His being and
be, even in the slightest degree, absolved from an
eternal identity therewith.</i> Once this idea is grasped
and its varied implications noted it then is no longer
conceivable that any other order or schematism can
be possible in our universe, and that, too, despite the
multiform conceptions peculiar to the varied systems
of philosophy.</p>

<p>The matutinal dawn of creation came at the close
of the tripyknotic movement which resulted in the
elaboration of materials, the initiation of principles,
processes and types, and the final preparation of the
field of evolution. The three processes or aspects of
non-manifestation projected in preparation for manifestation,
namely, monopyknosis, duopyknosis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
tripyknosis represent the earliest stages of germinal
development. When these had closed, the Great
Kosmic Egg began to germinate; the first faint, indescribable
signs of manifested life began to appear.
Involution set in. The fourth or quartopyknotic
stage, though only slightly differentiated, or rather
representing that period of kosmic involution when
that which is to become the manifested universe first
begins to fall under the sway of kosmic order, is
nevertheless the basis of all great world processes. It
is just midway between the poles&mdash;manifestation and
non-manifestation. During this stage the life elements
are receiving the imprints of character, being endowed
with directive tendencies and stored with such dynamism
as will persist throughout the Great Life Cycle
in which they are to manifest. It is here that begins
the movement of involution, the storing away of those
elements and factors, no more and no less, that are
to show forth on the upward path of evolution; it is
here that matter begins to assume form; electrons, ions
and atoms created, or, that those minute processes
which on the evolutionary side are to culminate in
these are originated. This is the metamorphotic
stage. It is the laboratory of the universe wherein
<i>Fohat</i>, the Creative Logos, prepares the materials
out of which and in which the vast diversity of
<i>morphons</i> or forms is created. Quartopyknosis, accordingly,
is the first active step, on the plane of
manifestation, which results in the appearance of perceptual
space and consequently of physical matter itself
as well as all the other grades of matter in the
kosmos. Space, brought into existence by the act of
the Creative Logos in imposing limitation upon His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
being, is in its primordial form composed of quartopyknons
or quadruplicate principles and tendencies
which act in unison and to the accomplishment of a
single end or purpose. On this plane or during the
continuance of this period of space-creation, the roots
of universal law and order are produced. In it are
planted the principles of good and evil and a sharp
line of demarkation established between all the conceivable
pairs of opposites which exist. It accounts
for the duality of life and form. Male-female;
father-mother; positive-negative; Rajah-Tamas (action-inaction)&mdash;all
these find in this process their
eternal origination. It is the stage of harmony, bliss,
ideality, perfection, perfect equilibrium and balance.
Here, innumerable ages before they actually appear,
the glow-worm and the daisy, the amoeba and the
dynosaur, man and the planetary gods alike abode
their time awaiting the toppling of the scales of kosmic
potency when all would be plunged headlong into the
endless labyrinth of becoming.</p>

<p>The quartopyknotic process is similar in all details
to the three preceding processes, these latter being
prototypes of all succeeding stages of involution.
The quintopyknon, accordingly, symbolizes the quintuplicative
action of life in its descending movement
toward the creation of matter in its densest form.
That is, it is a five-fold principle acting in unison and
kosmic consistency, infolding in the universal wherewithal
that which is to become mental matter on the
side of evolution. Just, as may be seen in the diagram,
Figure 17, the quartopyknotic process symbolizes,
on the involutionary side of the life current
that which is to become on the evolutionary side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
spiritual essence, so the quintopyknotic deposits the
seeds of that which is to become mental matter. During
both the quartopyknotic and the quintopyknotic
processes all the potencies and promises, residing on
the plane of non-manifestation and destined to show
forth as spirit and mind are brought into a fuller and
more marked degree of manifestation and become the
seeds of spirituality and mentality which are to ripen
and be ladened with the fruitage thereof many ages
hence.</p>

<p>The reader should bear in mind that the processes
here described are thought of as taking place at the
beginning and as having their roots planted in eternal
duration; that they refer to a period long before the
universe even resembled anything like its present
aspect; at a time even before there were individual
minds to perceive it, before even the gods&mdash;solar,
planetary, super-solar and super-planetary were in existence
to take part in the matutinal ceremonials of
creation's vast hour of stillness. The mind must
accustom itself to go back of appearances, back of
time, back of space itself and discern the foundations
of time, space and appearances being laid and to perceive
that which is no less than the action of the
Supreme Deity Himself in brooding over the primordial
formlessness which is Himself, and from which
will gradually evolve the universe of qualities, conditions
and appearances.</p>

<p>The quintopyknon is, therefore, the base of the
mind-principle in the kosmos. All the qualities of
mind whether in man or in the planetary gods, whether
in the moneron or the tyrannosaur, in the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
or the oak, reside in kosmic potency in the quintopyknon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas Malebranche</span>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> in one of his very
lucid moments, beheld the essential character of the
symbology of space and was led to the conclusion that
God is space itself. To him it was equally certain that
all our ideas of space, geometrical or purely physiological,
as well as our notions of the great suprasensual
domain of ideas, exist in the kosmic deiform,
or body of the Logos of Being. He saw "all things
in God." God did not create ideas; they are a part
of God Himself; God did not create mind; it is a part
of Himself; no kind of matter did He create; it is a
veritable part of Himself and indissoluble from Himself.
The great outstanding implication of this
philosophy is that our consciousness of God is but
a part of God's consciousness of Himself; our consciousness
of self and the not-self is but God's consciousness
of these things. There is no existence of
anything, either of the self or the not-self, except in
this consciousness. It is refreshing, therefore, to note
that although the approach is made from another and
entirely different direction, almost the same conclusion
as to the ultimate resolution of all chaogenetic elements
into what is the very systasis or consistence of
the great kosmic deiform, is reached.</p>

<p>But a marvelous vision comes with the dawn of
this truth upon the lower mind. It establishes clearly
the truth of <span class="smcap">Kant's</span> notion when he said: "Since
everything we conceive is conceived as being in space,
there is nothing which comes before our mind from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
which the idea of space can be derived; it is equally
present in the most rudimentary perception and the
most complete." The mind cannot get away from the
conception of space, because, out of the very essence
of space, as a result of the quintopyknotic process, it
was produced, created and organized. The idea of
space is, therefore, not derived from things in space
nor from their relations in space. <i>It sprang up with
self-consciousness.</i> As soon as the Thinker became
conscious of himself he became aware of space. The
very state of self-consciousness implies space. The
self in man is a specialized aspect of space. Indeed,
it is a projection of space. The moment the self can
say: "I am," it also can complete the declaration by
saying: "<i>I am Space</i>." When the self looks out from
his six-walled cabin of imprisonment into the immensity
of what we call space he looks out into that
which is himself and his immensity; he perceives the
source and the ever-present sustenance of his being
and recognizes his identity therewith, provided he does
not allow himself to become entangled in the philosophical
difficulties which the intellect is prone to
throw around the simple, yet marvelously complex,
notion of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>This should settle, once for all, the question of
<i>apriority</i>. The <i>a priori</i> inheres in quintopyknosis or
kosmic psychogenesis. It is the essential nature of
mind; it is the mind's lines of organization; it is the
law of the mind's being and action. All mental perception
originates from things in space. No thought
of any detail, of any state or condition, whether limited
or unlimited, related or isolated can be conceived
except it be of things in space. And this is so, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<i>mind and space are one</i>. It is not so with our conception
of time. Time is merely an aspect of consciousness
in its limitation and does not inhere in the
mind in the same manner that does space. In fact,
it is not a part of the mind's nature as it has been
shown that space is. It would, therefore, seem to be
a grave mistake so to coördinate the two notions.
Space is the progenitor of mind and is continually
identified with mind. Time is the child of consciousness.
That is, it is one of the illusions of consciousness
which the ego will shed as his consciousness expands.
Duration alone is a coördinate of space.</p>

<p>The mind now recognizes space as something apart
and separate from itself only because of its unconsciousness
of the identity existing between it and space.
Just so, it is not by mind alone that the <i>at-one</i> state
of consciousness shall be attained; for although in one
form or another it is able to gain some knowledge of
the apparent oneness of all life it cannot directly
realize this oneness. In order to do this fully it must
be able consciously to identify itself with the life, feel
what it feels and experience what it experiences and
otherwise come into a conscious relationship with the
root and source of life. Space-consciousness is a
simple, direct cognitive process; while time-consciousness
is a complex, and therefore, indirect process.
The former cannot be analyzed. That is, no analysis
is necessary to its sufficient comprehension; the latter
must always be analyzed and categorized for its sufficient
apprehension. Every moment of time whether
past, present or future, when presented to the consciousness,
is determined by its relationship to some
other moment of time. Space is indivisible; time is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
divisible. Space is an intuitional concept; time is an
intellectual concept. Time belongs to phenomena.
Space is the root and source of phenomena. Time is
the leaves of a tree while space is the life of the tree.</p>

<p>Space-consciousness, in its relation to the present
status of mind-development, is itself an illusion; for
despite the fact that the Thinker's apperception of it
as a state is simple, direct and fundamental, it is only
so because of the inability to realize to itself the unity
of the seeming two. The attainment of space-consciousness
or the space mind, which contrives the understanding
of the identity of mind and space also
annihilates the consciousness of space as a separate
notion from the mind. Once the Thinker's consciousness
has arisen to that state where it perceives its unity
with space all sense of separateness is lost. Just as
when two molecules of hydrogen uniting with one
molecule of oxygen to form a new compound lose
their identity in the new realization of unity, so does
the consciousness when by the alchemy of psychogenesis
it becomes identified with space, not only lose its
identity as such, but also any consciousness whatever
that space exists as something separate and distinct
from itself. Imagine the whole of the duration aspect
of kosmogenesis crowded into an infinitesimal instant
and the bulk of all matter, suns, stars, worlds and
planets, condensed into a space less than the magnitude
of an hydrogen ion and in this way a symbol of
what it may mean to attain unto absolute knowledge
or unto the space-mind, may be obtained.</p>

<p>Recurring to the process of quintopyknosis, it may
be noted that the quintopyknon or five-fold kosmic
principle of life which we have seen to be identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to the seeds of mental matter brought into existence
by the reaction of Fohatic energy or the Will of the
Creative Logos upon the substance of the quartopyknotic
stage, is, symbolically speaking, more dense and
compact than the pyknons of the preceding stages. It
is ensouled by the quartopyknon. It is a rather complex
state of ensoulment consisting of four condensations
or pyknoses.</p>

<p>The next stage in the process of kosmic involution
which is also concerned with the preparation of the
evolutionary field is that of sextopyknosis and implies
the senary condensation of the original world-stuff
with the view to the formation of emotional or "astral"
matter. Identically the same process of ensoulment
or involution obtains upon the plane of sextopyknosis
as have been observed to obtain upon the preceding
planes of involution. Involution must necessarily precede
evolution. That which has not been involved,
enfolded or ensouled cannot be evolved or unfolded.
Whatever potencies, powers and capabilities or qualities
and characteristics that may appear at any time
in the universe of life and form must have first been
involved or enfolded or else they could not have been
evolved. Space itself is an evolution. It is a process
of becoming, of unfolding, of flowering forth. As it
evolves more and more there will appear new and
added characteristics and qualities of life and form.
New possibilities will arise and in the end a supernal
vision of a glorified universe will burst into view.</p>

<p>The scheme of space-genesis is completed during
the septopyknotic process wherein the basal elements
of dense physical matter and its various gradations
are produced and given character, form and direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
But this completion means merely a temporary estopment
in the process of kosmogenesis which actually
results in the formation of physical matter in its
crassest state. It does not mean a final arrest of the
entire process which is conceived of as continuing only
in a regressive manner back to a kathekotic<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> condition
wherein it embodies the fruitage of the entire scheme.
The septopyknon, accordingly, is a seven-ply pyknon
in which are embodied, in varying degrees of manifestation
and phanerobiogenic (life-exhibiting) quality,
the essentialities of all that has preceded on all planes
and during all stages of space-genesis. That is to
say&mdash;in the physical life of the universe is confined the
essence of all the series of grades of life in the kosmos.
In man's physical body are wrapped up all the glories
attainable in his long, almost unending pilgrimage
of evolution; in it are stored all the possibilities of
the spirit; all powers, all qualities, all characteristics,
ever intended for man's attainment are in the physical.
But they must be evolved, they must be unfolded and
expressed. The physical must be <i>glorified</i>, <i>spiritualized</i>,
<i>deified</i>. For by the way of the glorification and
spiritualization of the flesh man may attain unto oneness
with the divinity in himself and consequently with
the divine life of the world.</p>

<p>To summarize: The genesis of space embraces
seven stages, namely, the monopyknotic, the duopyknotic
and the tripyknotic which belong to the plane
of non-manifestation and are the primordial world-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>stuff
and together make up the unmanifest body of the
Logos of Being. These become the seed-germ of the
universe of spatiality. The quartopyknotic is the
fourth stage in the process of space-genesis and is the
<i>metamorphotic</i> or crucial stage during which non-manifestation
is metamorphosed into manifestation.
In it the unmanifest becomes the manifest. It corresponds
to the plane of pure spirit, and indeed, embodies
within itself all the qualities which spirituality
is to show forth during the life of the kosmos. The
quintopyknotic is the fifth stage and corresponds to
the mental plane, embodying in itself all qualities of
mentality in the universe and furnishing the basis and
essence of that which is to become the kosmic mind
in manifestation. The sextopyknotic is the sixth
process and symbolizes the sixth stage which embodies
all the characteristics and properties of emotional matter
in the universe and is the basal element of the
plastic essence of sentient existence in the kosmos. The
septopyknotic is the seventh and final stage corresponding
to the physical plane of the kosmos and
contains in its seven-fold constitution the seeds and
potencies of all the preceding stages, as well as all
the characteristics and properties which physical matter
is destined to show forth during the <i>manvantara</i> or
world age. These seven processes result in the
dynamic appearance of space, the mother and container
of all things, and complete the involutionary
aspects of kosmogenesis. Evolution began where involution
ceased and will end for this <i>manvantara</i> when
the last vestige of those powers, capabilities and
potencies which were involved shall have been evolved
unto kosmic perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>The measure of the Great Kosmic Space-form was
sealed at the close of the involutionary movement of
the Great Life Wave. Then its metes and bounds
were fixed by the fringe of kathekosity which circumscribed
it.</p>

<p>If it be true that the reader found it extremely
difficult to grant the connotations of the symbolism
when the mental or quintopyknotic stage was reached
when illative cognizance was given to the fact that
space is also composed of mental matter, it may be
still more difficult to grant the claim that physical
matter is also essentially a part of space. But this
is the implication. <i>And, therefore, it follows that all
matter, all energy, all life and all mind wherever it
may be found in the Great Space-Form is space itself
and nothing but space.</i> Hence, it appears that space
is indeed the dynamism of the universe. In its kosmic
womb the great world egg was formed of its own
substance solely and in it still the universe of form
persists and evolves withal.</p>

<p>If it be suitable for the physicist to talk of gravitation,
electricity, magnetism and force let him do so,
for these terms serve the present category of human
knowledge; but the human mind will not lament the day
when it comes to recognize that these things, these forces,
these aspects are nothing more than space-activities and
space-phenomena. If a planet's place be preserved in
space it is because space, vital, dynamic, creative space,
sustains it and from its gentle, yet eternally firm grasp
there is no escape. All that the planets, suns and
worlds are and all that they may ever become in this
<i>manvantara</i> or world age have been derived from
space, yea, are of the very essence of spatiality. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
chemist choose to talk of chemism, negative and positive,
of combining properties and dissociative phenomena
let him also become aware that these phenomena
are but the external aspects of the inner and ephemeral
life-processes of space-forms and that ultimately these,
too, may be traced back into an eternal originality
within the bosom of the all-mother, spatiality.</p>

<p>Dense physical matter, such as constitutes the
physicality of celestial bodies in its ultimate dissociation
would, accordingly, be resolved into the original
chaogenetic formlessness which marked the chaogeny
of non-manifestation although it would naturally be
orderly and progressive passing through the seven
stages, septopyknosis, sextopyknosis, quintopyknosis,
etc., until the end had been reached, meanwhile exhibiting
in each plane the phenomena peculiar to the
dissociative processes thereof. On this view space is
a <i>plenum</i> of matter of varying degrees of intensity,
ranging from the densest physical to the most tenuous
and formless matter of the highest levels of the manifested
universe. But as neither the dense material
forms nor the other grades of matter have an eternally
enduring quality, being alike subject to mutation, space
likewise falls under the law of becoming whereby it,
too, must yield to the edict of kosmic disorder.</p>

<p>Some may be inclined to argue that since space and
mind are one and the same thing it must necessarily
follow that whatever possibilities of measurement may
be found to exist in the mind would logically be found
to exist in space; and that since all the necessary conditions
of hyperspatial operations are proved to be
existent in the mind the case of the hyperspatiality of
perceptual space is proved thereby. In other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
if the fourth dimension can be proved to be mentally
construable it is also possible in perceptual space. But
these hypotheses are not granted, and neither will they
be acceptable to those minds who choose to take that
view when it is known that there is a marked difference
between the mind that is purely intellectual and mind
that is purely intuitional or mind <i>a priori</i>. The intellect
is fashioned for matter only; it is so constructed
as to fit squarely into every nook and cranny, every
groove and interstice in matter; yet for the generating
element, life, it has no aptitude nor suitable congruence.</p>

<p>The attainment of the space-mind or kosmic consciousness
would then imply a mastery of all fundamental
possibilities pertaining to all degrees of matter.
Thus by becoming conscious in the matter of all the
planes one makes a certain definite approach to this
ultimate state of consciousness until all the barriers
between ordinary self-consciousness and the consciousness
of the space-mind have been entirely obliterated.</p>

<p>Pyknosis, in all of its septenary aspects, is concerned
primarily with involution or the preparation of
the chaogenetic elements for the work of kosmic
evolution. It may be thought of as being divided into
two great divisions, namely: <i>chaogeny</i> and <i>chaomorphogeny</i>.
It is concerned with the organization
of chaos, the establishment of kosmic geometrism in
the formless, void, arupic substance and preparation
for evolution. Chaogeny, of course, is that kosmic
process by virtue of which space itself becomes manifest
and in which there is no established order.
Chaomorphogeny (from <i>Chaos + Morphe + Geny</i>) signifies
the activities of the creative Logos in laying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
foundations in primordial space-matter of the various
star-forms, including nebulæ, worlds, planets, suns,
etc., of which Canopus, Jupiter, Fomalhaut and Sirius
and our own sun are examples, giving direction and
general tendence to their varied life-processes. Both
these processes are concerned with the preparation of
the field and its consequent fertilization in anticipation
of its cultivation and harvest. These two constitute
kosmic involution or the great life wave's passage on
the downward arc of the Great World Egg or Circle.
It is during the chaomorphogenic cycle that the constitution
of the universe of manifestation is promulgated;
when laws for its government during that
<i>manvantara</i> are sketched out in the world of nascent
spatiality; when the archetype of every imaginable or
possible form is projected upon the impregnated
screen of creation, then folded in, pushed toward the
center, involved, awaiting that time when the life wave
begins its passage upon the upward arc and evolution
ensues, calling forth all that has been enfolded in the
bosom of the pyknotic centers of manifestation. It is
easily conceivable that here during the troublous times
of the chaomorphogenic enfoldment the now known
six directions of space were among the eternal edicts
of space-genesis and that that law which now makes
it appear that three coördinates, and only three, are
sufficient for the determination of a point position in
space was imprinted in the very nature of that which
was to become space.</p>

<p>The kosmic field having been prepared as a result
of the chaomorphogenic activities, lowly and scarcely
organized forms begin to appear and the ascent upon
the upward arc of the Great Cycle commences. Evo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>lution
begins. Its scope is likewise divided into two
great stages, namely: (<i>a</i>) Morphogeny, the purpose
of which is the development of life-forms or pyknons
which are to appear on the various planets, stars,
worlds and suns of the universe. It embraces the
whole span of the life-aspect on the evolutionary side
of manifestation. In this aspect is included also every
conceivable adaptation of the universal principle of
life from the beginning of its movement to the end.
The universe is now functioning in and progressing
through the vicissitudes of this stage. That is, all the
present observable adaptations which the life-pyknon
or principle is making, has made or will make, are
embraced within the scope of what is here designated
as the morphogenetic aspect of evolution. (<i>b</i>) The
second and last division of the arc of evolution is called
<i>Kathekos</i>, thus symbolizing the syncretism of the
trinitarian aspects of kosmogenesis, <i>Chaos-Theos-Kosmos</i>,
perfected and united as a result of the labors
of manifestation. In this final summation of the labors
of the life-wave as it has progressed from involution
through all the devious manifestations of evolution are
embodied the perfection and ultimate elaboration and
expression of all the pyknotic tendencies which were
established during the entire scope of space-genesis.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the first three stages of
space-genesis, called chaogeny, encompass the first three
pyknotic processes or are analogous thereto while the
latter called chaomorphogeny, the organization and
ensoulment of space-forms, embraces the latter four,
quartopyknosis, quintopyknosis, sextopyknosis and septopyknosis.
This division obtains on the involutionary
side of the great life-cycle. The upward arc of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Great Kosmic Egg or Cycle is also divided into two
great stages, namely, Morphogeny (manifestation of
life through the various forms which it assumes) and
<i>Kathekos</i>, or the kathekotic plane of perfected triunity
which is represented by the evolutionary union of
<i>Chaos-Theos-Kosmos</i>. <i>Kathekos</i> would, therefore,
symbolize the ultimate elaboration of Chaos into a
well-ordered kosmos wherein are expressed all the
possibilities which inhered in the archetypal plan of
the Creative Logos or <i>Theos</i> and in which all had
reached the ultimate perfection in the body of being
of the Logos Himself. But the kathekotic plane is
to be distinguished from the original <i>Chaos-Theos-Kosmos</i>
represented as functionating upon the plane of
non-manifestation during chaogeny. <i>Kathekos</i> symbolizes
the perfected manifestations of the triune
aspects of the Creative Logos through the perfected
forms resulting from the labors of kosmic evolution,
while <i>Chaos-Theos-Kosmos</i> symbolized, as a triune
<i>glyph</i>, the Unmanifest Trinity in the primordial beginnings
of space-genesis. One is the seed; the other
the fully matured plant; one the egg; while the other
is the full grown bird; one the root; the other the
fruitage; one Alpha, the other Omega; one the beginning,
the other the end. The end, however, is
reached only that, in due time, the entire scheme may
be commenced again, once more utilizing the results
of the preceding scheme of evolution as the basis
of the ensuing one. Thus after every Kosmic Day,
commences the Kosmic Night. The succession of
kosmic days and nights is infinite. This infinity of
<i>becomings</i> in the life of the kosmos is a necessary
outcome of eternal duration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The above, thus briefly set down, is the symbolism
of space-genesis. It is commended to the reader as a
basis for the conception that the real, essential, perceptual
space is something far more wonderful, more
fundamental than either the geometrician or the metageometrician
has ever dreamed of, and yet the latter's
consciousness is undoubtedly being appulsed by the
fingers of a new species of conceptualizations which,
one day in the not too distant future, will arouse in
it the faint hungerings after the realization of the real
space-nature. These mathetic appetites thus brought
into being will finally lead the human mind into the
Elysian fields of kosmic consciousness where for another
million years, perhaps, it may feed upon the
mysteries and hypermysteries to be found in the
granaries of the Space-Mind.</p>

<p>The study of space in its wider and deeper meanings
is necessary in order that a clearer understanding
of its true significance, as the subject of geometric
researches, may be gained. It is confessed, however,
that there is neither direct evidence nor implicative
authority for any assumption that the view herein outlined
affords any justification for the notion of the
n-dimensionality of space. For, although the line of
reasoning indulged in must lead inevitably to the conclusion
that the worlds of spatiality, materiality, intellectuality
and spirituality, essentially and fundamentally
one so far as origins and qualities are concerned,
were alike engendered by the same generating
element, life; and that spatiality being the primal basis
of the others is, nevertheless, under the exigencies of
this aspect of the kosmos, highly susceptible to the
mensurative requirements of the grossest, there ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>pears
to be no necessity for calling upon extraneous
considerations for assistance in our efforts to comprehend
the various connotations of the symbolism.
Then, too, it is easily conceivable that under
conditions where these elements, spatiality, intellectuality
and materiality, are not only co-extensive but
interpenetrative, there is no justification for the assumption
that they must exist in layers or manifoldnesses
or in discrete degrees, separated from one
another as if they were constituted of different substances
and occupied different spheres. For every
single point in perceptual space is a focus for lines
drawn through every conceivable grade of materiality,
spatiality or intellectuality in the kosmos. And the
same system of coördinates which is necessary and
sufficient for the localization of a point in our space
is also sufficient for the location of a point anywhere
in the entire world of spatiality, intellectuality or
spirituality. In fact, the external, visible worlds of
materiality and spatiality are nothing more than the
<i>mass-termini</i> of lines extending from divinity to
physicality; from primordial originality to kosmic
modernity and it is intellectually conceivable that progression
back over the grooves made by these mass-termini
of lines would lead directly and unerringly to
originality itself. In spite of the manifold pyknoses
which we have shown to characterize the symbolism
of space-genesis it is a very simple matter; for the
entire scheme could and must have proceeded along
strictly tridimensional lines. Tridimensionality must
have inhered in the primeval archetype of space or else
it could not appear as an outstanding fact of perceptual
space now; for all that we can now observe in space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
as characteristics must have first been included, enfolded,
involved, before it could have been evolved.
Hence, it is to be remembered that we are to-day dealing
with the expressions of tendencies and principles
which inhered in the manifested universe as potentialities
in the very beginning.</p>

<p>The alphabet of space-genesis consists of five characters,
namely, the point, the line, the triangle, the
square and the circle. These are the pentagrammaton
of space, of intellectuality, materiality and of spirituality.
They constitute the basis of kosmic geometrism.
With these all geometrical figures may be constructed;
with them all magnitudes may be delineated and projected.
They describe every conceivable activity of the
Creative Logos and designate the bounds of the entire
scope of motility of kosmogenesis.</p>

<p>In figure 19, are shown the dot, the line, triangle,
square and the circle which together form the kosmic
pentoglyph. The point symbolizes kosmic inertia,
inactivity or the beginning of motion; the line
is the first aspect of motion, the beginning of creation;
the triple aspect of kosmogenesis is symbolized by
the triangle, <i>Chaos-Theos-Kosmos</i>, the Unmanifest
Trinity; the square emblematizes kosmic being in evolution;
while the circle is the syncretism of all these
and stands for the perfected kosmos, or the kosmos
in process of perfection. Very truly did <span class="smcap">Plato</span> remark:
"God geometrizes"; for the <i>pentagrammaton</i>&mdash;the
point-line-triangle-square-circle&mdash;is the deity's way
of manifesting Himself. But there is here no need
for space-curvature nor for triangles whose value is
greater or less than 180 degrees; there is no need even
for the mathematical fourth dimension.</p>

<p>It cannot be believed, however, that metageometricians
are really in earnest in what they suggest of
hyperspace and <i>n</i>-dimensionality; it cannot be believed
that they are entirely satisfied with what they have
found of the so-called hyperspatial, and yet, some of
them are fanatically patriotic over the new-found
domain; some are even intolerant.  But there are
others who look upon the fabric of metageometry as
a stepping stone to space-realities, a mile-post on the
path to the realization of a higher consciousness, the
consciousness of the space-mind or kosmic consciousness.
And may this not, after all, be the goal of the
human intellect, now slightly distraught by the exuberances
of youth and the joys of a new mental freedom?
The work of the future mathematicians will
be the destruction of the tumorous inconsistences to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
be found in the various non-Euclidean systems of
geometrical thought, the elimination of the novelties
and the nonsensicals, the synthesizing of those elements
which are sanctioned by the space-mind and the building
thereon a sane interpretation of space-phenomena
in the light of illuminations received from greatly extended
faculties and a participation in that larger consciousness
into which the human race seems slowly
to be immerging.</p>

<p>The domain of hyperspace is but the fairy-land of
mathesis, peopled with goblins, gnomes, kobolds, elves
and fays which are the spaces, dimensions, propositions,
ensembles and theorems of the metageometrician.
But like the fairies and nature spirits of the
unseen about us, they have their bases in the real,
objective world of facts however difficult it may be
to establish their direct connection with it. As the
gay, invisible sprites of phantom-land represent intelligent
natural forces at work in the furtherance of
the evolution of forms, so the impalpable things of
mathesis are emblems of kosmic forces at work in the
upbuilding of structures of higher consciousness which
shall be towers of vision for the human soul whence
it may view the hill-crests of infinite knowledge and
the low-lying plains of kosmic mysteries.</p>

<p>Finally, it has been noted that space is the very
consistence of the kosmos; it is the life, the form and
both the outer and the inner manifestation of the combined
life and form; it is reality, also illusion; it is
concrete, also ideal. We have noted also that mind
is consubstantial with space and that space gives it
its inner life and nature as well as nourishes its outer
growth and development. In fact, we have seen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
space and mind are <i>one</i> essentially and that they exist
as aspects of the same thing, life. In whatever way,
then, that the mind normally views space that is the
natural way. All attempts to deviate from the natural
way are, therefore, unsanctioned by the nature of
things. So long as geometry remains true to the
nature of mind and space so long will it be valid universally
and possessed of kosmic necessity and invariance.
It behaves most unseemly when it departs
from its fealty to the nature of things <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>Both the outlook of the mind upon the objective
world as well as its inlook upon its own states of
consciousness or the subjective world are tridimensional.
Its growth is tridimensional, its nature is
likewise tridimensional, and there is not even the
slightest tendence either to perceive, conceive or perform
in a four-dimensional manner, mathematically
speaking. Trace out the biologic development of each
mental faculty, from the mind of the moneron to the
mind of the most highly developed man and it will
be found that everywhere and always, without variation
or exception, the nature of each of these has been
to express itself tridimensionally and naturally. There
is not even the slightest sign of so much as a germinal
appetence for the four-space; it would, therefore,
seem almost a prostitution of mental faculty to divert
mental energy into the seemingly useless channel of
present-day metageometrical researches; yet, it must
be admitted that even though the end sought cannot
be attained, the final results of the intellectual delvings
into the dread homogeneity of kosmic origins and the
consequent realization of the awesome coevalism of
mind and space whence shall arise the recognition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the wondrous unitariness of all existences, will be that
we shall come upon that thrice mysterious contrivance&mdash;the
Heart of Divinity, the Kosmic Space-Center in
which abide the roots of the <i>Great All</i> in a marvelously
indescribable unity and infinite originality.</p>

<p>We may conclude, then, that hyperspatiality and
all its appurtenances are but the toys of the childhood
of humanity. But, as the years pass and the days of
maturity come on apace, it, toy-like, will also be discarded.
And the mind will seize then upon the seriousness
of reality just as the matured youth responds
to the stern realities of life and manhood responsibilities.
But no one can say that the toys of childhood
are wholly useless; no one can say that the joys which
they bring are entirely fatuous and unreal nor shall
we attempt to intimate that mathetic contrivances are
without utility, without purpose and significance in the
life of the growing mind of humanity. But they, too,
will pass away.</p>

<p>The fragmentariness of the Thinker's outlook
upon the universe of spatiality is due to the inhibitive
action set up by the constrictive bonds which his complicate
mechanism of intellectuality interposes between
himself and reality. The Thinker, who stands back
of and uses the various media of objective consciousness,
such as the neural mechanisms, brain, emotions,
his individualized life-force and the mind which together
make up the instruments with which he contacts
the sensuous domain, by adapting his consciousness
to these means, as the artisan utilizes his tools,
constitutes his own intellectuality. The intellectuality,
then, is the totality of media by which consciousness
effects its entrance into the sensuous world and by
which it receives impressions therefrom. In other
words, it is the sum of all those qualities, operations,
processes and mechanisms which are recognized as
constituting the <i>modus vivendi</i> of man's intellectuality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and these are, in reality, nothing more than the ego
himself.</p>

<p>Many have been inclined to regard that which has
been called the ego as the highest sovereign power in
the state of manhood. He has been looked upon as
the final consideration in the constitution of the human
being. But the ego is an evolutionary product and
the concomitant of self-consciousness which is the
I-making faculty in man's psychic life. It is that
quality of consciousness which makes man conceive of
himself as a separate, detached and independent being.
It is a purely intellectual or tuitional product,
and, as such, is to be differentiated from the intuitional
or life-quality which is the essence of man's real selfhood.
With respect to the Thinker, the ego occupies
precisely the same status as the agent to his principal.
As the agent is the representative of the principal in
all matters which come within the scope of his prescribed
jurisdiction so is the ego the agent of the
Thinker who is a spiritual intelligence. Accordingly,
from an ethical viewpoint the Thinker is responsible
for the acts of the agent and can in no wise escape the
penalties accruing as a result of the agent's violations.
Just as a commercial firm sends out a representative
for the collection of data concerning certain phases
of its business or it may be of any business or the
entire world market so the Thinker projects his own
consciousness into the mechanisms which are in their
totality the egoic life. That is, he sends out his agent,
the ego, into life and into the objective world of facts
and demands that he shall convey to him, from all
points of the territory which he is expected to cover,
reports of his findings. Of course, these reports which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
are transmitted by the ego (the intellectual mechanism
of the Thinker) are more or less well prepared summations
of his individual observations and deductions.
These are the percepts which the ego presents to the
Thinker's consciousness. Concepts are formed by the
Thinker in his treatment of these sense-presentations.
It very frequently happens that the ego transmits reports
which, for one reason or another, give very
imperfect knowledge of the matter which his reports
are designed to cover. Often it is necessary that additional
and supplemental reports be made about the
same thing, and even then, it is well-nigh impossible,
if not quite so, for him fully to cover every detail of
the matter under consideration and in no case is it
possible for him to do more than report on the superficialities
of the question under scrutiny. If the ego,
in his operations, be imagined to be hampered by
similar circumstances and difficulties as those which
would ordinarily beset a commercial attaché it will
then be clear that his reports must ever be fragmentary
because of the inaccessibility of much of the data which
would be necessary for a full report, and further, because
of the inadequacy of his methods and means of
gathering data due to the inherent limitations of his
capabilities, endurance and perspicacity and innumerable
other limitations and difficulties which must be
faced in all search for the real. So that, while the
sufficiency of the means which the ego enjoys at this
stage for all practical purposes is granted no hesitancy
is entertained when it comes to a discovery of
the reals of knowledge in declaring their insufficiency.</p>

<p>Then, too, when it is remembered that these egoic
reports are in the nature of neurographical communi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>cations
which are similar to telegraphic despatches and
must pass through several stations, as ganglia, etc.,
often being relayed from one to another, it will be
quite apparent that much, even of the original quality
of the missives forwarded, will have been lost or
radically changed in some way before it is finally delivered
for the inspection of the Thinker himself. It
not infrequently happens, even in perfectly normal
beings, that the ego in filing, recording, transcribing,
interpreting, translating and otherwise preparing these
data for the Thinker's use, lets a cog slip, misplaces
some of the data, loses or destroys fragments of it
and so is unable to maintain a complete portfolio of
his materials.</p>

<p>As the Thinker is entirely dependent upon his
agent, the ego, for the trustworthiness of his information
covering the matter of the sensuous world it is
obvious that at best his information is very fragmentary
indeed, and necessarily so when it is considered
that the <i>modus operandi</i> of his agent and the
difficulty of his operations are so complicate as to
magnify the obstructions in the way to complete freedom
in this regard.</p>

<p>To continue the similitude of principal and agent
it may be asserted that it is also true that the commercial
house that sends out its attaches frequently
will send letters containing directions as to procedure,
sometimes censuring for past delinquencies and sometimes
commending for praiseworthy deeds; and this,
too, in addition to the original instructions which were
given at the outset. It even comes to pass that the
home office, because of some meretricious accomplishment,
as the marked increase of efficiency shown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the agent's close application to his duties and the consequent
success of his operations, confers certain favors
upon the agent or removes some of the restrictions
which were originally imposed, gives an increase in
salary or promotes the agent to a higher and more
lucrative office with larger powers and greater authority.
This is analogous to what the Thinker does for
the ego. For he not only receives reports from the
ego, but often, in the shape of intuitions, gives additional
information as to the proper manner of doing
things, sheds more light upon some obscure operation,
commends for duty well performed, condemns
for failures or for wrong-doing, rewards arduous toil
with greater powers of vision, keener insight, greater
capabilities; in fact, promotes the ego in the sight of
other egos by marking him out as an exceptional ego.
But the curious aspect of this procedure is that, in time
and after the ego has been repeatedly commended
and promoted and otherwise favored by the Thinker,
he begins to think that he owns the firm, that he is
the life and main support of the whole corporation.
He becomes arrogant, self-willed and finally falls into
the illusion that he alone is responsible for the phenomenal
success of the firm. This is the source of that
illusion of the intellect which makes itself think that it,
the ego, is all there is to man, that his instruments of
operation in the objective world are the only kind
of instruments that may be used; that his method of
gathering data about things is the only safe and sure
method; and so it develops that the intellectuality is
the source of man's separateness, his individuality and
his apparent aloofness from other men and things. It
is, of course, needless to point out that in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the intellect comes to be the tyrant of man, ruling with
a rigid monopoly and as an all-exclusive autocracy.</p>

<p>From the above implications it would appear that
the intellect and the intuitive faculty are two separate
and distinct processes, and so they are. One is the
inverse of the other. The tendence of the egoic life
or the intellect is for the external while the intuition
is an internal process. The intellect acts from without
towards the interior while the intuition acts from
within outward. The intellect is the product of the
intuition which is another term for the consciousness
of the Thinker on his own plane. Just as the child
lives a separate and distinct, though dependent, life
from the parents so the intellect has a <i>modus vivendi</i>
which is distinct and separate from that of the Thinker,
and yet it is in all points dependent upon the life of
the Thinker. Here again, we find an analogy in the
relation of the child to the parent. As some children
are more amenable to the will of the parent than
others, so, in some persons, the intellect is more amenable
to the action of the intuition than in others. Yet
it is a certain fact that the more the outward life is
governed by the intuition, i.e., the more the intellect
responds to the intuitive faculty of the Thinker, the
higher the order of the life of the ego and the more
accurate his decisions and judgments. In fact, it assuredly
may be asserted that the place of every individual
in the scale of evolution is determined in a
very large measure by the degree of agreement between
the intuition and the intellect or by the ease with
which the intuition may operate through the intellect
as a medium. At least, the quality of one's life may
be determined directly by these considerations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>The Thinker being himself a pure spiritual intelligence,
living upon the plane of spirit and therefore
unhampered by the difficulties which the ego meets in
his operations in the objective sensorium, and possessed
of far greater knowledge, is correspondingly
free from the limitations of the ego and very naturally
closer to kosmic realities. Hence, he is better situated
for the procurement of correct notions of relations,
essentialities and the like. It is believed, therefore,
that in the proportion that these two processes, the
intellectual and the intuitional, are brought, in the
course of evolution, to a closer and more rigid agreement,
in the proportion that the Thinker is able to
transmit the intuitograms in the shape of concepts or
that the intuition is made more and more conceptual,
in just that proportion is humanity becoming perfect
and its evolution complete. The difficulty found to
inhere in the conceptualization of intuitions so that
they may be propagated from man to man seems not
to lie in the Thinker himself, but more essentially in
the ego, in the intellectuality and its complicate
schematism or plan of action. It would appear,
therefore, that the only way of escaping or transcending
this difficulty is for the ego so to refine his vehicles
or so facilitate his plan of action by eliminating the
numerous relays or sub-stations intervening between
the consciousness of the Thinker and that which may
be said to be his own that the transmission of intuitograms
may be accomplished with the greatest ease
and clearness. While no attempt will be made to indicate
the probable line of action which the ego or
objective man will adopt for this purpose, it is believed
that it may be said without pedanticism that the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
true method of attaining unto this much desired state
of things is, first of all, by assuming a sympathetic
attitude not only towards the question of the intuition
itself but to all phenomena which are an outgrowth
of, or incident to, the manifestations of the intuitive
faculty through the intellectuality, and second, by the
practice of prolonged abstract thought, this latter procedure
effecting a suspension of the intellectuality
temporarily at the same time allowing it to experience
an undisturbed contact with the intuitional consciousness,
thereby laying the basis for future recognition
of its nature and quality. It would seem that these
two conditions are absolutely necessary in order that
a more congruent relationship may be promoted between
these two cognitive faculties. Ordinarily, it
would appear that the philosopher who is undoubtedly
inured to the necessities of continuous abstraction or
the mathematician whose most common tasks naturally
fall in this category would be among all men most
apt to develop to the point of conceptualizing intuitograms
readily, yet it seems that this is not the case.
And there is good reason for it. The mind of the
philosopher and the mathematician is intellectual
rather than intuitional and is, therefore, wedded to
matter, to the action and reaction of matter against
matter and hence operating in a direction at variance
with the trend of an intuitional mind. And this condition
is undoubtedly due to a lack of a sympathetic
attitude towards this species of consciousness. At any
rate, it is thought that a too great anxiety in this
respect need not be entertained by humanity at all,
for the reason that in the case of a faculty, the rudimentary
outcroppings of which are so marked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
universally observable and existing in greater or lesser
degrees in various human beings, there is ample evidence
for the belief that it is being carefully and duly
promoted by a well-directed evolution of psychic
faculties and powers, so that at the proper time, determinable
by the state of perfection reached by the
intellectuality or the ego in the operation of his cognitive
processes, the much desired agreement of these
two faculties will have been realized and the conceptualization
of intuitograms into propagable conceptions
an accomplished fact. Until this goal shall have been
reached and the intuition shall have overshadowed the
intellect as the intellect now overshadows the intuition;
or the consciousness of the ego, derived from the interplay
of the Thinker's consciousness among the
various elements which constitute the ego himself, shall
have been merged with that of the Thinker, the outlook
must remain fragmentary, only becoming a well-ordered
whole as the barriers of dissidence are broken
down in succession.</p>

<p>The evolution of consciousness, from the simple,
undifferentiated <i>moneron</i> to the differentiated cell and
from that to the cell-colony and from the cell-colony
to the organism, traversing in successive paces
through all the stages of lower life&mdash;mineral, vegetable
and animal&mdash;to the stages of the simple, communal
consciousness of the higher animals, to the
self or individual consciousness of the human being,
each requiring millions of years for its perfection before
a more advanced stage is entered, has been one
continuous relinquishment of the lower and less complicate
for the higher and more complex expression
of itself through the given media. When a newer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
higher stage of consciousness is being entered by humanity
its appearance or manifestation is first made
in the most advanced of the race and that only in a
dim, vague way. This rudimentary condition persists
for some time, perhaps many thousands of years, then
the faculty becomes more general in appearance, the
number of advanced individuals increases, and consequently,
as in the case of the intuitive faculty, it becomes
universally prevalent in all humanity; becomes
transmissible as so-called "acquired characters," and
then appears as the normal faculty of the entire
human family cropping out in each individual. Thus,
in passing from the few advanced ones in the beginning
to that stage where it becomes the common
possession of all, a faculty requires many thousands
of years for its perfection, and especially has this been
true in the past history of the development of human
faculties. But it is believed that the sweep of the
life current as it proceeds from form to form, from
faculty to faculty, gains in momentum as it proceeds,
so that in these latter years due to the already highly
developed vehicular mechanisms at its disposal not
so great a period of time as formerly is required for
the <i>out-bringing</i> of a new faculty. It might well be
that while in the past hundreds of thousands of years
were necessary in the perfection of organs and faculties,
in these latter days only a few thousand, perhaps
hundreds, may be necessary and that in the days of
the future not even so many years may be required
to universalize a faculty. And especially does this
appear to be true in a state of affairs where so large
a number of persons are beginning consciously to take
their evolution in hand and by volitional activities are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
supplying greatly increased impetus to their psychic
processes which under ordinary, natural methods
would be considerably slower in their development.
It is quite obvious that all cultural efforts when applied
to the betterment of a given plant, animal or faculty
result in a corresponding hastening of the process of
growth far in excess of what that growth would be
under normal, natural conditions. All the present
faculties possessed by man are remarkably susceptible
to cultural influences; in fact, the standing edict of
ethical and social law is that the human faculties must
be cultivated as highly as possible, thereby giving the
spirit a more perfect medium of expression. These
observations, therefore, lead irresistibly and unavoidably
to the conclusion that the time for the upspringing
of the intuitional faculty in the human organism is
even now upon us, that undoubtedly in certain very
advanced ones it has already reached a notable degree
of perfection and is rather more general than would
appear in the absence of careful investigation.</p>

<p>Now, just as the intellect has made for individuality,
has emphasized the separateness of the Thinker's
existence from that of other thinkers, has developed
self-consciousness to a very high degree, even pushing
it far over into the domain of the higher consciousness
to the temporary obscuration of the latter, so the intuitional
will make for union, for the brotherhood
of man, for co-operation and for the common weal.
Through it man will come gradually into the consciousness
that fundamentally, in his inner nature, in
every respect of vital concern, he is at-one with his
fellowmen and not only with the apparent units of
life but with all life as expressed in whatsoever form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
throughout the universe. Then, too, he will be closer
to the reality of things, of actions and natural processes;
in fine, he will have begun the development of
the space-mind which will bring him to the knowledge
that he is one with space also and, therefore, with the
divine life of the world.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of the vital force which
shows itself in the consciousness as man's intellect,
is its growing <i>automatism</i>, or that tendency which
enables the consciousness to perform its functions
automatically and thus allow opportunity for the development
of newer and higher faculties. Actions,
oft repeated, tend to become automatic. This is also
true of thought and consciousness. It is one of the
beneficent results of abstract thought that it develops,
or tends to develop, a kind of automatism whereby
a marked saving in time and energy is effected. This
affords opportunity for other things. It is undoubtedly
true that in the days of the truly primitive man
his consciousness was more completely engaged in the
execution of the ergonic functions of cells, organs and
tissues; that all those processes which are now said
to be involuntary and reflexive were at one time, in
the distant past of man's evolution, the results of
conscious volitions. This is a condition which must
have preceded even the development of the intellect
itself. Indeed, there could be no intellect in a state
where the entire modicum of consciousness was being
utilized in the performance of cellular and histologic
functions.</p>

<p>The rise of the intellect must have been in direct
ratio to the development of automatism among the
cells, tissues and organs, so that as these came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
gradually to perform their special labors reflexively
the intellect began to be formulated and to
grow, at first only incipiently, then more and more
completely until it reached its present state. At the
present stage of its evolution, a great deal of the
labor of the intellect is beginning to fall into a kind
of increscent automatism, although only rudimentarily,
in many instances. Yet, as a result of this tendency,
quite the whole of the phenomena of perception is
characterized by a sort of automatic action. And the
mind perceives without conscious volition. Many of
the steps of conceptualization are automatic, in part,
if not wholly. Certain it is that impulses once set
in operation whether consciously or unconsciously continue
to act along the same line until exhausted or
until the end has been attained. Consequently, it is
a proven fact that often serious mathematical and
philosophic problems have been solved by the mind
long after any conscious effort to solve them had
ceased. Often solutions have been arrived at during
sleep. Many such cases might be cited, but the
phenomenon is now so common that almost every one
can cite some experience in his own life that will substantiate
the claim.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that these phenomena
are evidences of a reflexive development in the
intellect. The time will come undoubtedly, and necessarily
so if the intellect is to give way to a higher
faculty, which shall be as much above the intellect in
its grasp of things as the intellect is now above the
simple consciousness of the lower animal, when quite
the entirety of our intellectual processes will become
automatic or self-performing. What then remains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the egoic schematism, after its transmutation or elevation
as the organ of the intuitional consciousness
will be utilized as the organ of the Thinker's involuntary
cognitive processes. This will mean that all
of that laborious ideation which is now the abstract
thought of the Thinker will be performed automatically,
leaving the higher aspect of the egoic consciousness
free to conceptualize or intuitograph the
intuitions. Perceptualization then will be replaced by
conceptualization. This latter will occupy about the
same status as the former does now. And necessarily,
perception will become more complex. In other
words, while we now perceive simple percepts which
are again arranged into concepts making a composite
picture of the object, we shall then be taking in the
composite picture of the object at first hand, thereby
dispensing with the rather slow process of perception
as it now operates. We shall still be perceiving, but
what we perceive will be concepts rather than percepts,
as at present.</p>

<p>The increased powers of intellection gained as
a result of the increscent <i>automatism</i> in the intellect,
the flowering forth of the intuitive faculty
and the general enhancement of the intellect throughout
all its processes will enable it to entertain concepts
or composite pictures of things just as readily
and as perfectly as it can at present deal with a single
percept. Concepts will be replaced by super-concepts
or intuitographs. Increased perspicacity will enable
the Thinker to manipulate the concepts and intuitographs
with the same ease and readiness and withal
the mind will have attained unto an almost unrealizable
freedom in its search after truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The outcome of this new adjustment which, of
course, will not spring up at once, but by insensible
degrees, will be the clarification and unification of our
knowledge. It will mean also the simplification of it;
the obviation of diversities of opinions, the springing
up of a new and winnowed system of philosophy
which shall be the true one; further, it will imply the
lessening of the probability of error in our judgments
and conclusions; the removal of illusion to a much
larger degree than to-day is possible and the realization
by every one of something of the essence of things,
of causes and effects, of actions, operations, natural
forces and laws; in fact, a condition of mind which
will present to the consciousness the simple truth above
every conceivable phase of kosmic life which may come
within the scope of the Thinker's observation.</p>

<p>The further implications of this view are that there
is a difference between the Thinker and the intellectuality.
The Thinker is eternal and partakes, therefore,
of the very essence of primordial originality
while the mentality is an artificial process, the resultant
of the adaptation of the Thinker's consciousness
to his vehicular contrivances of objective cognition and
the interplay of his life among them.</p>

<p>If the appearance of a choppy sea disturbed by the
passage of a brisk breeze over its surface be imagined,
a similitude of the great ocean of life may be envisaged.
The wavelet crests symbolize the egos; the
base of the wavelet which is one with the great sea
of water represents the Thinker which is one with
the divine life and consciousness of the kosmos. Just
as wavelet crests are continually springing up and
falling back into the sea, so are egos continually being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
cast forth and reabsorbed into the universality of
life only to be recast, as a wavelet crest or ego,
upon the surface of the moving ocean of life. <i>And
so, in this respect, the universum of life and consciousness
which are essentially one is in a constant state of
ever-becoming, un-becoming and re-becoming.</i></p>

<p>Another implication is that, on account of the diversity
and complexity of the means of contact with
the external world, it is not possible for the ego to
arrive at more than a fragmentary understanding of
even the latent geometrism of life, mind and materiality.
In our examination of the sensuous world, we
are very much like the three blind men set to examining
an elephant. One set to scrutinizing his trunk
by means of his sense of feeling. When asked for
his judgment as to what the elephant was he declared
it was a snake; a second who began with the legs
found it to be like huge pillars; and a third who caught
hold of the elephant's tail and declared the elephant
to be like a rope. Each one of the blind men described
what he was able to perceive. To each what he felt
was all there was upon which he could render judgment.
And so, artists, philosophers, mathematicians,
musicians, mechanicians, religious seers, metaphysicians
and all other types of mind, are just so many
blind men set to the examination of an elephant, or
the sensuous world. Each one confidently believes his
view to be correct; each one is satisfied with the deliveries
of his senses. Yet no one of them is wholly
correct, no one of them has seen every phase and
aspect of the problem. Does it not, therefore, appear
to be the more reasonable and urgent that the view
which synthesizes the judgments of all the possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
examiners thereby constructing a composite idea of
the entire mass of judgments is the more reliable and
the more correct?</p>

<p>Referring again to the dual intelligence, the ego
and the Thinker, which together constitute man, it is
deemed necessary, in order to present the concept of
this duality to the mind of the reader in the way that
shall enable him easily to recall it, to designate the
egoic intelligence as the <i>egopsyche</i>, and the Thinker's
intelligence as the <i>omnipsyche</i>.</p>

<p>The egopsyche is the I-making faculty, the faculty
of self-consciousness and the synthesis of all those
psychic states and functions known as the intellect or
mind and includes the ethical aspect of man's nature.
The omnipsyche is the organism of kosmic consciousness,
the space-mind, or man's higher self and that
which connects with or allies him to all life; it is the
basis of human unity and of unity with divinity, just
as the egopsyche is the basis of separation and individuality;
it is the organ of direct and instantaneous
cognition and the permanent essence which has persisted
through every form which the being, man, has
ever assumed and through every stage of human evolution.
In it are stored up the memories of the Thinker's
past, the secrets of life, mind, being, reality, and the
history of life from the beginning; in it also the plan
of action for the future of the life-wave as it passes
from plane to plane, from stage to stage, and from
form to form. It is the spark from the flame that
is never quite free from its source; it is the continuous
spark, the prolonged ray which does not go out and
cannot be extinguished. It is that in man which when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
full union therewith has been attained makes him a
god in full consciousness.</p>

<p>The omnipsyche is really a neglected and overlooked
factor in the doctrine of evolution. Evolutionists,
while they claim life to be continuous and
that man has come through all the kingdoms of nature
in succession and has spent millions of years in the
perfection of his various organs, faculties and stages
of consciousness, make no ample allowance for what
is in reality the basal element in evolution&mdash;a continuous,
persisting, permanent life-force which does not
lose its identity from the beginning to the end of the
process. This fact&mdash;that that spark of life which set
out upon the evolutionary journey as a moneron has
glowed steadily from that stage to manhood, maintaining
meantime its original purposiveness and intent&mdash;seems
to be the most obvious consideration of the
whole doctrine, yet it has been more or less completely
ignored. The elementary requirements of
evolution would seem to establish clearly the necessity
for some such eternally persisting principle as the
omnipsyche which is capable of such subtle adaptations
to every conceivable form of life and in which should
be gathered up the evolutionary results of every life-cycle.
For this purpose the omnipsyche or unifying
principle in man was designed from the beginning and
it is that which constitutes the basis of his intellectual
nature while in a far larger sense it is the divinity
in man himself. It is indeed strange that so important
a factor as the omnipsyche should have been omitted
by evolutionists. Yet it can be accounted for upon
the grounds of the purely mechanistic character of all
intellectual attempts at solving the problems of vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
manifestations. But so long as men rely upon
mechanical explanations of such phenomena so long
will they be prone to overlook the very essentialities
of the problems which they devoutly wish to solve.
The continuity of the physical germ-plasm of the
human species,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> now quite generally admitted, would
suggest, it seems, an analogous condition to the continuity
of the psychic plasm called the omnipsyche, the
only difference being that the omnipsyche is an intelligent
factor while the physical plasm is a medium
of transmission though non-intelligent. The omnipsyche
is, therefore, the psychic reservoir of evolution
into which are stored the transmuted psychics of
moneron, amoeba, jellyfish and every other form
which it has ensouled and acts as the storeroom of
man's psychic operations as well as the source of his
intellectuality.</p>

<p>We turn now from the study of a sketch of the
mechanism of man's consciousness which gives at its
best only a fragmentary view of the universe of spatiality
to a consideration of space itself in the light
of its interrelational bearings upon the question of
intellectuality.</p>

<p>In the chapter on the "Genesis and Nature of
Space" we have, in tracing out the engenderment of
space, proved it to be basically one with matter (and
indeed the progenitor of matter), also with life and
consciousness. Further, it has been shown that all the
characteristics of materiality are due to the adaptation
of consciousness to it and that out of this adaptation
grew the intellectuality. A close approximation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
this view was maintained by <span class="smcap">Kant</span> when he discovered
that our faculty of thinking or the intellect only finds
again in matter the mathematical order or properties
which our faculty of perceiving or consciousness has
deposed there. It appears, therefore, that when the
intellect approaches matter or spatiality it finds always
a ready yieldance to its demands simply because intellectuality
has previously established therein the delineation
or map of the path over which it necessarily
must traverse in its examination of the object of its pursuit.
In other words, the kosmic mind in engendering
materiality and spatiality has set up therein a kosmic
order or geometrism. Both motor and intellectual
progress, therefore, can be made through the world of
spatiality because of the immanence of this kosmic geometrism
which lies latent in the very fabric of the world
of substance fashioning both the character and the
nature of the intellect as well as of space itself. So that
there is a perfect congruity subsisting between spatiality
and intellectuality. Accordingly it is impossible
for either one or the other to transcend the grim grasp
of the mathematical order which binds them in such
lasting and fundamental agreement. Extra-spatiality
may degrade itself into spatiality, and indeed in the
very nature of the case, does so degrade itself, yet
spatiality can never raise itself beyond the limits set
by its engendering parent. Materiality may become
more and more spatialized and consciousness more and
more intellectualized, but they must proceed hand-in-hand
one not superseding the other.</p>

<p>Being the essence of the natural geometry which is
everywhere immanent in the universum of matter,
space becomes an organized and ordered extension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
in fact is the totality of such organized and ordered
extension, which conforms to the latent geometrism
the engenderment of which it is the sole cause
in the last analysis. Does it not appear then that all
that mass of artificial geometry which has sprung up
as a result of departures made from this natural
geometry is utterly baseless and most certainly lacking
in the kosmic agreement which spatiality lends to our
primary conceptions? Of course, it is admittedly possible
to devise certain conventional forms of logic and
endow them with all the evidences of a rigid consistency
but which, because of their purely artificial
character, will fall far short of any real conformity to
the potential geometrism which has been established in
spatiality. And this fact is of utmost significance for
all those who seek to find justification either logically
or naturally for the existence of a multi-dimensional
quality in space; for, if a clear, discriminative conception
as to the categorical relationship, each to each,
of the two kinds of geometry be carried in mind, it
will not be easy to confound them neither will it be
difficult to discern where the one ends and the other
begins.</p>

<p>Now, the fourth dimension and the entirety of
those mathematical speculations touching upon the
question of hyperspace, dimensionality, space-curvature
and the manifoldness of space are purely conventional
and arbitrary contrivances and do not meet with any
agreement or authority in the native geometrism which
we find inhering in space and which the intellect recognizes
there. This conclusion seems to be obvious for
the reason that, in the first place, the non-Euclidean
geometries have been constructed upon the basis of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
negation of the latent geometrism of space and intellectuality;
and if so, is it reasonable to expect that
either they or any of their conclusions should accord
with the nature of that form of geometry so admirably
delineated by <span class="smcap">Euclid</span>? Obviously not. It is a matter
of historical knowledge that the whole of the artificial
non-Euclidean geometries consists of those purely conventional
results which investigators arrived at when
they denied or controverted the norms supplied by the
natural geometry. When metageometricians found
that they could neither prove nor disprove the
Euclidean parallel-postulate they then set upon the
examination of idealized constructions which negatived
the postulate. The results, thus obtained, although
self-consistent enough, were compiled into systems of
geometry which naturally were at variance with each
other and with this inherent geometrism which is found
in spatiality and answered to by the intellect both
normally and logically.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is another consideration which
to us seems to be equally if not more forbidding, in
its objections to the coördination of the two systems
of geometry, and that is the fact that the geometry
of hyperspace is denied the corroborative testimony of
experience and this is true of practically the whole
of its data. Indeed, there is perhaps no single element
in its entire constitution which claims the authority of
experience. This is undoubtedly the weakest point in
the structure of the hyperspatial geometries. Contrarily,
such is not the case with the natural geometry;
for, in this, the intellect in retracing its steps over the
path laid out by that movement which has at the same
time created both the intellect and spatiality, finds an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
orderly and commodious arrangement into which it
naturally and easily falls. So exact is this agreement
of the intellect with the kosmic order that if it were
possible to remove the whole of spatiality and materiality
there would still be left the frame work which
is this latent geometrism of kosmogenesis. But the fact
that the intellect naturally fills all the interstices of materiality
and spatiality, fitting snugly into all of them as
if molded for just that purpose, by no means warrants
the assumption that it would or does also fit the engendering
factor which has created these interstices.
The frame work, the order or the geometrism of the
kosmos has been established by life acting consciously
upon the universum of materiality. And in order to
establish this geometrism life had to be mobile, active,
creative. It could not remain static, immobile, and
accomplish it. Being mobile, dynamic, creative, it
passes on. It is like a fashioning tool which the cabinet
makers use in cutting out designs upon a piece of
wood. It moves, and keeps moving until the design
is finished, and then it is ready for more designing.
Life is like that. It cuts out the designs in materiality,
fashions the form, molds the material, and passes on
to other forms. The intellect fits into these designs
gracefully. But what it finds is not life itself, only
the design which life has made. Hence, as there is
neither an empirical spatiality nor materiality in conformity
with which the artificial geometry of the
analyst may be said to exist, and as it may not be
said to conform to the path which life has made in
passing through either of these, it is absurd to predicate
it upon the same basis as the natural geometry.
And so, we are forced, in the light of these considera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>tions
to deny the validity and hence the acceptability
of the non-Euclidean geometries as either reasonable
or warrantable substitutes for the Euclidean, and denying
which we also formally ignore the claims of the
fourth dimension, as mathematically designed, to any
legitimate anchorage in either our vital or intellectual
movements.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the flow of life, as it describes
that movement which we call evolution, engenders
simultaneously and consubstantially spatiality,
materiality and intellectuality, and these, in turn, the
natural order or geometrism everywhere immanent in
the universe; and that automatically, one out of the
other and each out of the all, these constitute the totality
of kosmic fundamentals. Also we have sketched the
mechanism of man's consciousness and discovered how,
in its evolutionary development it has divided into two
aspects, the egopsychic and the omnipsychic, and these
two factors ally him definitely and adequately to the
world of the senses and to the world of supersensuous
cognitions. And thus we have cleared up some of the
misconceptions which had to be confronted and made
more easy the approach to the central idea, thereby
conserving the substantiating influence which a general
and more comprehensive view of the whole would
naturally give.</p>

<p><i>The totality of kosmic order is space. It is circumscribed
by an orderless envelope of chaos just as
the germ of an egg is surrounded by the egg-plasm.
The organized kosmos is the germ, kernel or central,
nucleated mass, enduring in a state of becoming. Involutionary
kathekos or primordial chaos is the egg-plasm
which nourishes the germ or the kosmos and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
is that out of which the germ evolves. Kathekos or
chaos is the unmanifest, unorganized, unconditioned,
unlimited and undifferentiated plasm. Space is the
manifest, limited, finite, organized germ that, feeding
upon the enveloping chaos, exists in a perpetual state
of alternate manifestation and non-manifestation&mdash;appearing,
disappearing and reappearing indefinitely.</i></p>

<p>The appearance of the kosmos as an orderly
elaboration of the involutionary phase of kosmogenesis,
in so far as kosmic order may be said to be an
accomplished fact, marked the turning point in that
procedure whose function it was to make manifest a
universe possessing certain definite characteristics of
orderliness; but the kosmos, as it now stands, may not
be thought of as having attained unto a state of ultimate
orderliness. The idea meant to be conveyed is
that between the point of becoming and the actually
pyknosed, or solidified stage in the process of creation
there is a more or less well defined line of demarkation
cutting off that which is spatiality from that which is
non-spatiality. Beyond the limits of spatiality is an
absence of geometric order. Here geometry breaks
down, becomes impotent, because it is an intellectual
construction; at least, it is not so apparent as in the
manifested kosmos. It is a state about which it is
utterly futile to predicate anything; because no words
can describe it. The most that may be said is that
it is absence of geometric order as it inheres in space.
And if so, all those movements comprehended under
the general notions of spatiality, materiality, intellectuality
and geometricity have both their extensive and
detensive or inverse movements nullified in their approach
to it. Involutionary <i>Kathekos</i>, therefore, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
be said to be the primordial wilderness of disorder
which outskirts the well laid-out and carefully planned
garden of the spatial universe. We may excogitate
upon some of the obvious functions of this kathekotic
world-plasm; but in doing so we must leave off all
attempts at a description of its appearance, its magnitude,
extent or other qualities, and think only of its
kosmic function. We cannot say that there is back
of it a spatiality nor can we say that it is a spatiality;
for whatever may be its extent or volume, it suffices
that it may not be said to be space. It is chaos. Space
is order, organization, geometricity. It cannot be said
that there is a latent geometrism in chaos; because
geometric order is found only in spatiality and is that
which distinguishes spatiality from kathekosity or non-spatiality.
Chaos is the lack of spatiality. This, of
course, implies that it is impenetrable to the intellectuality
or to vitality. All inverse movement such
as is discovered as taking place in spatiality and which
results in the phenomenalization of space runs aground
when it strikes against the rock-bound coast of kathekosity.
We can only say that it is both the point of
origin for the evolving universe of life and form and
its terminus. It is the nebulosity out of which the
whole came and into which all is ultimately occluded.</p>

<p>A great and far-reaching error is made in all our
thinking with respect to the kosmogonic processes
when we postulate the complete absorption of chaos
as an early act of kosmogony. Customarily, we think
of kosmic chaos as a primordial condition whose existence
was done away as soon as the universe came into
active manifestation. This because it has been exceedingly
difficult, if not quite impossible, for those whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
privilege it was to determine the trend of philosophic
thought to free themselves from the bondage of a
dogma which owed its existence to a traditional or
legendary interpretation of facts that ought never
have been so interpreted. Chaos <span class="smcap">IS</span> and <span class="smcap">EVER SHALL BE</span>,
so long as the universe itself lacks completion, fullness
or perfection in purpose, extent and possibility. It
is undoubtedly being diminished, however, in proportion
as the kosmos is approaching absolute perfection.
And when the last vestige of chaos disappears from
the outerskirts of the maturing kosmos there shall appear
a <i>glorified universe</i> of indescribable qualities.</p>

<p>Space being a perception <i>a priori</i> cannot be determined
wholly by purely objective methods. The
yard-stick, the telescope and the light-year are objects
which belong exclusively to the phenomenal and with
them alone never can we arrive at a true conception
of the nature of space. We can no more demonstrate
the nature of space by the use of objective instruments
and movements than we can measure the spirit in a
balance. Certainly, then, it cannot be hoped that by
taking the measurement of space-distances in light-years,
or studying the nature of material bodies, we
shall be able to fathom this most objectively incomprehensible
and ineluctable thing which we call space.
It is such that every Thinker must, in his own inner
consciousness, come into the realization of that awfully
mysterious something which is the nature of space both
as to existence and extent by his own subjective efforts
unaided, uncharted and alone. When we measure,
weigh, apportion and otherwise try to determine a
thing we are dealing with the phenomenal which is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
more the thing itself than a shadow is the object which
casts it.</p>

<p>What does it matter that metageometricians shall
be able to demonstrate that space exhibits itself
to the senses in a four- or <i>n</i>-dimensional manner?
Granting that they may be able to do this,
if merely for the sake of the discussion, when they
have finished, it will not be space that they have
determined, but the phenomena of space, its arborescence,
while space itself remain indeterminate and
unapproachable by phenomenal methods. If there
are curvature, manifoldness and <i>n</i>-dimensionality
these are not properties of space, but of intellectuality
in its cultured state and when it is, therefore,
removed from the native state of conception.
Scientists may be able to weigh the human body,
count every cell, name and describe every nerve,
muscle and fiber; they may even be able to know it
in every conceivable part and from every physical angle
and relationship, and yet know nothing of the life
which vitalizes that body and makes it appear the
phenomenal thing that it is. So it is not by instruments
which man may devise that we shall be able to
determine the true nature and purpose of space. We
must adopt other methods and means and assume other
angles of approach than the purely objective in order
to comprehend space which, being the sole inherent
aspect of consciousness, can be understood best by applying
the measures which the latter provides for its
understanding. It would appear, therefore, that the
best study of space is the consciousness itself, knowing
which we shall know space.</p>

<p>The universum of space, including the phenomenal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
universe, and its relation to consciousness may be
likened to a conical funnel whose base represents the
phenomenal world of the senses and whose apex or
smallest point represents ultimate reality.</p>

<p>In Figure 20, we have endeavored to symbolize
graphically this conception of space. The base marked
"Sensorium" represents the sensible world. That
marked "Realism" symbolizes the ultimate plane of
reality, the inner essence of the world, the plane of
"things-in-themselves."</p>

<p>The cone arising from the base "sensorium" symbolizes
the objective world as compared with consciousness;
the subverted cone, with apex in the sensorium,
represents the evolving human consciousness.</p>

<p>The successive bases have the following symbology:
Self-consciousness, Communal Consciousness, Mikrocosmic
Consciousness, Makrokosmic or Universal
Consciousness, the Plane of the Space-Mind Consciousness,
Divine Consciousness, Kathekotic Consciousness,
or the Plane of Final Union with the Manifest Logos.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness is that form of consciousness
which enables the ego to become aware of himself as
distinguished from other selves or the Not-self; the
Omnipsychic or Communal Consciousness is that form
of consciousness from which arises the realization by
the Thinker of his oneness with all other thinkers and
with other forms of life. Mikrocosmic consciousness
denotes a still higher form of consciousness, as that
which enables the Thinker to become conscious of
his living identity with the life of the world or the
planet on which he lives. It represents a stage in the
expansion of consciousness when it becomes one with
the consciousness of the planet upon which it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a><br /><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
be functioning. Makrokosmic consciousness accomplishes
the awareness of the Thinker's unity with the
life of the kosmos or universe. The space-mind and
the consciousness which constitutes it enable the
Thinker to comprehend the originality and the terminality
of kosmic processes. It is archetypal so far
as the life-cycle of the universe is concerned because
the beginning, the intermediate portion and the ending
of the kosmos are encompassed within it. Divine consciousness
is that form of consciousness which arises
upon the unification of the Thinker's consciousness with
that of the manifest deity; it is, in fact, omniscience.
The kathekotic consciousness belongs to the ultimate
plane of reality; to kosmic origins and chaogeny, and
therefore, pertains to the plane of non-manifestation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/fig20.jpg" alt="" ></img>
  <br />
 <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span>&mdash;Kosmos and Conciousness
</span></div>

<p>The implications are that in comparison with the
sensorium, the Thinker's consciousness is a mere point
in space. It is, in reality, so small and insignificant
that the extensity of the physical world or universe
seems unlimited, unfathomable in meaning and infinite in
extent. But as his consciousness expands, as it passes,
in evolutionary succession from one plane of reality
to another and higher one, the illimitability, the incomprehensibility
and infinity of the universe grow
ever smaller and smaller, until the plane of divine
consciousness is reached. Then the previously incomprehensible
dwindles into insignificance, lost in the real
illimitability, infinity and unfathomability of consciousness
itself. Kosmic psychogenesis, as exhibited
and specialized for the purposes of the evolution of
the Thinker, can have no other destiny than the flowering
forth as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of manifestation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
is nothing short of unification with the highest form
of consciousness existent in the kosmos.</p>

<p>It is not to be considered really that the scope of
space is diminished but that the growing, expanding
consciousness of the Thinker will so reduce the relative
extension of it that illimitability will be swallowed
up in its extensity. Consciousness, in becoming infinite
in comprehension, annihilates the imaginary infinity
of space. Accordingly, that which now appears to be
beyond mental encompassment undergoes a corresponding
diminution in every respect as the consciousness
expands and becomes more comprehensive. <i>The
mystery of space decreases as the scope of consciousness
increases.</i> As the Thinker's consciousness expands
the extensity of the manifested universe decreases.
Thus the mystery of every aspect of kosmic life lessens,
and fades away, as the intimacy of our knowledge
concerning it becomes more and more complete.
There is no mystery where knowledge is. Mysteriousness
is a symbol of ignorance or unconsciousness, and
that which we do not understand acts as a Flaming
Sword keeping the way of the Temple of Reality lest
ignorance break in and despoil the treasures thereof.</p>

<p>Figure 21 is a graph showing a sectional view of
consciousness on all planes represented as seven concentric
circles. This describes the analogous enveilment
of the consciousness when it ensouls a physical
body or when bound to the purely objective world of
the senses. The overcoming of the barriers of reality,
represented by the circumscribing circles is the work
of the Thinker who is forever seeking to expand and
to know. For only at its center, as symbolized here,
is the consciousness at one with the highest aspect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
kosmic consciousness and there alone is the mystery
of space despoiled of its habiliments.</p>

  <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;Septenary Enveilment of Consciousness
</span></div>

<p>Accordingly, as consciousness or the Thinker is
more and more divested of carnal barriers and illusions
there develops a gradual recognition of the unitariness
of spatial extent and magnitude; there arises
the certain knowledge that space has but one dimension
and that dimension is sheer <i>extension</i>. The
Thinker's sphere of awareness is represented as if it
begins as a point in space and develops into a line which
divides into two lines, the boundaries of the space cones.
Thus it may be perceived that the ancients had a similar
conception in mind when they symbolized kosmogenesis
with the dot (.), the line, and the circle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
diameter inscribed, which together represent the universe
in manifestation.</p>

<p>We realize the impossibility of adequately depicting
the full significance of the inverse ratio existing
between the extensity of space and the increscent inclusivity
of consciousness by means of graphs; for
neither words nor diagrams can portray the scope and
meaning of the conception in its entirety. Yet they
aid the intellect to grasp a ray of light, an intimation
of what the Thinker sees and understands interiorly.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to note the function
of the ideal in the evolution and expansion of
consciousness. The ideal has no perceptual value; it
has no status in the world of the senses. It is unapproachable
either in thought or action, and therefore,
lies beyond the grasp of both the intellectuality and
the vitality. It is indescribable, inconceptible and
searchless; for the moment that we describe, define,
or approach the ideal, either intellectually or vitally,
in that moment it ceases to be ideal, but actual. It flees
from even the slightest approach; it never remains
the same; it cannot be attained, at least its attainment
causes it to lose its idealty. It is then no longer the
ideal. It is like an <i>ignis fatuus</i>; the closer we come
to it the farther away it recedes. It hangs suspended
before the mind like the luscious grapes which hung
before the mouth of the hungry Tantalus. As the
grapes and the water receded from his reach at every
effort he made to seize them so the ideal remains
eternally unseizable and unattainable. Whatever,
therefore, is in our thought processes, or in our knowledge,
that may be said to be <i>ideal</i>, does not really
exist. The ideal is a phantom growing out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
nature and essence of the intellectuality. Its purpose
is to lead merely the mind on; to allure it, to tantalize,
and compel it to grow by exertion, by the struggle
to attain, by the desire to overcome. In this respect,
it serves well its function in the economy of intellectual
evolution. It is a mysterious aspect of the
original and eternal desire to live which is the kosmic
<i>urge</i> present in all organized being and has its roots
hidden in the divine purpose of creation.</p>

<p>Idealized constructions, then, are like Arabian
feasts conjured up by a famishing mentality. They
are like the dreams of a starving man in which he
actualizes in phantom-stuff the choicest viands in
abundant supply for his imaginary delectation. The
mind that is satisfied never idealizes, never makes an
idealized construction. It is only when an "aching
void" is felt, when a longing for the realization of
that which it has not arises within itself, when a
feeling of distinct lack, a want, a hankering after
something not in its reach, takes possession of the
mind that it begins to idealize. That is why some
minds are without ideals. It is because they are satisfied
with what they have and can understand. They
feel no hungering for better and grander things; they
have no desire to understand the unknown and the
mysterious; hence they do not idealize; they make no
attempt to represent unto themselves a picture of that
which is beyond them. Such minds are dormant,
hibernant, asleep, unfeeling and unresponsive to the
divine urge.</p>

<p>But the ideal is neither obtainable objectively nor
subjectively, neither phenomenally nor really, so that
when we come upon the ideal in our mode of think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>ing
we have arrived not at a finality or end, but at
that which is designed to lead us on to something
higher, to nobler accomplishments and more extensive
conquests. When we have devised idealized
constructions, therefore, we should not therewith be
content but should scrutinize them, examine and
study them for their implications; for thereby we may
discover the path and the guide-posts to a new domain,
a new ideal, following which we shall, in time, come
to a point in our search for the real where the
fluxional is at a minimum; we shall reach that something
which will admit of no further struggle&mdash;the last
chasm between the phenomenal and the real&mdash;and
standing on the bridge, consciousness, which engages
the twain, shall have a complete view of that Sacred
and Imperishable Land of Kosmic Realism where like
a fleeting cloud of sheerest vapor shall be seen the
phantom-ideal deliquescing and disappearing in the
cold, thin air of the real and the eternal.</p>

<p>Since space is judged to be infinite by the intellect
occluded in such clouds of illusion and hampered by
such constrictive bonds of limitations, as it now endures,
we have no right to conclude that the concept
of infinity would still linger before the mind's eyes
when the illusionary veil is removed; in fact, there is
ample reason to believe, nay for the assertion, that
the recession of the veil will reveal just the opposite
of this illusion, namely that space is finite, and even
<i>bounded</i> by the fringe of chaogenetic disorderliness.
Either we perceive the real or we do not; either the
pure <i>thingness</i> of all objects can be perceived or it
cannot be perceived. If not, granting that there is
such a thing as the real, it must be within the ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
range of conceivability. It also seems reasonable that
realism exists somewhere, and if so, must be sought
in a direction inverse to that in which we find the
phenomenal and the approach thereto must necessarily
be gradual, continuous and direct and not by abrupt
breaks, by twists and turns. The phenomenal must lie
at the terminus of the real, and <i>vice versa</i>. So that
by retracing the path blazed out by the real in coming
to phenomenalization we shall perhaps find that which
casts our shadowy world, just as by tracing a shadow
in a direction inverse to that in which it extends we
may find the object which projects it.</p>

<p><i>It is not out and beyond that we shall find the end
of space; it is not by counting tens of thousands of
light-years that the supposed limits of space shall be
attained. The path of search must project in an opposite
direction&mdash;not star-ward but Thinker-ward, toward
the subtle habitation of the consciousness itself.</i>
We err greatly when we think that by measuring distances
we shall encompass space; for that which we
measure and determine is but the clouds caused by
the vapor of reality. It is, therefore, not without,
but within, in an inverse direction that the search
must proceed. Going back over the life-stream, beginning
where it strikes against the shores of solid
objectivity, deeper and deeper still, past the innermost
mile-stone of the self-consciousness, back into the very
heart of the imperturbable interior of being where the
Thinker's castle opens its doors to the Great Kosmic
Self, from that open door-way we may step out into
that great mystery of space&mdash;limited, yet not limited,
multi-dimensioned, and yet having only one dimension,
veritably real and fundamental, the Father-Mother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
all phenomena. Here the great mystery of mysteries
is revealed as the citadel of the universal and the
ultimate real. In this citadel, the plane of kosmic consciousness,
space loses its spaciousness and time its
timeliness, diversity its multiplicity and oneness alone
reigns supreme.</p>

<p>But the movement towards the center and circumference
of space, after this manner, requires aid neither
from the notion of space-curvature nor that of the
space-manifold, except, indeed, only in so far as a
state of consciousness or a degree of realism may be
said to be a tridimensional manifold. The feeling
that space is single-pointed, and yet ubiquitously centered,
has been indulged by mathematicians and others
in a more or less modified form; but they have
imagined it in the terms of an indefinite proceeding
outward until in some manner unaccountable alike to
all we come back to the point of origin. It has been
expressed by <span class="smcap">Pickering</span> when he says that if we go
far enough east we shall arrive at the west; far
enough north we shall come to the south; far enough
into the zenith we shall come to the nadir. But this
conception is based upon a notion of space which is
the exclusive result of mathematical determinations and
subject to all the restrictions of mathetic rigorousness.
It requires that we shall allow space to be
curved. This we decline to do for the reason that it
is both unnecessary and contrary to the most fundamental
affirmations of the <i>a priori</i> faculty of the
Thinker's cognitive apparatus. It would seem to be
necessary only that we should extend our consciousness
backward, revert it into the direction whence life came
to find that which we seek. By extension of conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>ness
is meant the ability to function consciously upon
the various superkosmic spheres or planes just as we
do on the physical. Yet it should be quite as easy to
devise an idealized construction which would imagify
the results of this ingressive movement of the consciousness
as to represent the results of a progressive
outward movement star-ward. Having done so the
examination of them could be conducted along lines
similar to those followed in the scrutiny of objective
results.</p>

<p>What would it mean to the Thinker if he were
able to identify his consciousness with the ether in
all its varying degrees; what would it mean if he were
able to identify his consciousness with life and with
the pure mind-matter of the kosmos; and lastly, with
the spiritual essence of the universe? What if his
various vehicles of awareness were available for his
purposes of cognition? What, indeed, if he could
traverse consciously the entire gamut of realism and
consciousness from man to the divine consciousness?
Does it not appear reasonable that as he assumed each
of these various vestures of consciousness, in succession,
he would gradually and finally, come to a full understanding
of reality itself? It seems so. This view is
even more cogent when it is considered that the
limitations, and consequent obscuration of consciousness
are proportional to the number of vehicles or
barriers through which the Thinker is required to act
in contacting the phenomenal universe. Common sense
suggests that freedom of motility is determined by the
presence or absence (more particularly the latter) of
bonds and barriers; that the less the number of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
barriers the greater the scope of motility and consequently
greater the knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plato</span> evidently had this in mind when he
imagined the life of men spent in cave-walled prisons
in which their bodies were so fixed that they were
compelled to sit in one prescribed position, and therefore,
be unable to see anything except the shadows
of persons or objects as they passed by. He conceived
that men thus conditioned would, in time, suffer
the diminution of their scope of consciousness to such
an extent as to reduce it to identification with the
shadows on the walls. Their consciousness would be
mere shadow-consciousnesses the entire data of which
would be shadowgraphs. So that for them the only
reality would be the shadows which they constantly
saw. A similar thing really happens to man's consciousness
limited to the plane of the objective world.
Things which are not objective do not appear as real
to him, if they do appear at all. It is not that there
are no other realities than those which appear to the
egopsychic consciousness or that fall within its scope;
but that this form of consciousness is incompetent to
judge of the nature and appearance of those realities
which do not answer to the limitations under which
it exists. And so, with men whose data of consciousness
or whose outlook upon the world of facts, or
rather life, are confined to the narrow bounds of mathematic
rigor and exclusiveness, there may appear to
exist no realities which may not be defined in the terms
of mathematics. Similarly, to the empiricist, used
to measurements of magnitudes, weights, and rates of
motion, there may also appear to be no realities which
are not amenable to the mold of his empirical con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>trivances&mdash;the
balance, the chromatic and the scalpel.
All of these are shadow men constricted to the metes
and bounds of shadows which they observe only because
they are ignorant of the realities which lie without
their plane.</p>

<p>Life has so many ways of exhibiting its remains
to the intellect; and these remains have so many facets
or viewpoints from which they may be studied, that
nothing short of a panoramic view of all the modes
of exhibition and of all the facets and angles of appearances
will suffice to present a trustworthy and
comprehensive view of the whole. Then, life itself
is so illusive, so unseizable by the intellect that the
testimony of all investigators are required to summarize
its modes of appearance. And, therefore,
eventual contentment shall be secured only when the
mass of diverse testimonies is reduced to the lowest
common divisor, and for this purpose the operations of
every class of investigators must be viewed as the work
of specialists upon separate phases, facets and angles
of life's remains.</p>

<p>And so it is manifestly absurd for the empiricists,
by taking note of the dimension, extent, quality and
character of the shadows, or one single class of angles,
to hope to predicate any trustworthy judgments about
either the realities which cast the shadows or underlie
the angles; because whatever notion or conception
they may be able to gain must of necessity be merely
fragmentary and entirely inadequate. Despite this
fact, however, we still have the spectacle of men who,
studying the sensible universum of space-content, endeavor
either to make it appear as a finality in itself,
or that the world of the real must necessarily be con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>formable
to the precise standards which they arbitrarily
set up in their examination of the objective
world. It can be said with assurance that we shall
never be able even so much as to approach a true
understanding of the unseen, real world until we shall
have changed our mental attitude towards it and
ceased to expect that it shall necessarily be fashioned
and ordered in exactly the same way as the world of
our senses, or that it shall be understood by applying
the same methods of procedure as those which we
use in our examination of the phenomenal, sensuous
world. It is a matter of logical necessity that, as
there are no senses which can respond to the real,
as there are no organs which vibrate in accord with
the rates of vibration of the real, there can be no
reasonable hope of understanding it by means of
sensuous contrivances and standards.</p>

<p>Let the consciousness, therefore, be turned not
outward, but <i>inward</i> where is situated the temple of
divine life; let there be taken away the outward sheaths
which enshrine the pure intelligence of the Thinker;
let him grow and expand his sphere of awareness; let
there be an exploration of the abysmal deeps of mind,
of life and consciousness; for buried deeply in man's
own inner nature is the answer to all queries which
may vex his impuissant intellectuality.</p>

<p>Kosmic truth has many facets. The rays of light
which we see darting from its surface do not always
come from the core. Often they are reflections of
rays whose light stops short at the superfice; and
these, in turn, are reflections of deeper realities. Thus
the reflected light may be traced to its source by
following the lead of external reflections. It is now
known that moonlight, and perhaps, in many cases,
starlight, are reflections of sunlight, if not of our sun,
some other in the universe. But it is only at certain
times and under certain conditions that we can see
the sun which is the source of the other kinds of
light. The stars which owe their light to suns are so
many facets of sunlight. The moon is a facet of
sunlight also. Facts are facets of truth. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
so many faces of eternal truth. They represent the
many ways reality exhibits itself, or rather its effects,
to the consciousness. When we, therefore, become
aware of facts we have not in virtue thereof become
aware of the reality which produces the facts. We
have come to know only something of the termini of
realism while the complexities and internal ramifications
which lie between realism itself and these termini
altogether elude our cognition.</p>

<p>Let us examine briefly an icosahedron, for instance.
An icosahedron is a figure comprehended under twenty
equal sides. These various sides are so many faces
by means of which the figure presents itself to the
consciousness. These faces, however, are not the real
object. The figure may be examined by viewing it
from any one of its sides; yet, by simply examining
a single face, or any number of faces, less the total
number, we arrive at no satisfactory knowledge of
the magnitude or its substance. We must first become
conscious of all the faces, holding them in mind
as a composite picture, before we can even begin to
have anything like a complete notion of the icosahedron.
Then by continuing the examination we may
find that the magnitude is composed of wood fiber
or stone or metal, as the case may be. In this way
we might carry the examination to indefinite limits
and finally arrive at a very comprehensive knowledge
of the icosahedron and yet be unaware altogether of
the forces which have been at work in the production
of the magnitude or of the reality which lies back
of it.</p>

<p>Realism is psychological and vital. In essence it
is mind, spirit, life. Yet these three are one. Mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
is the outward vehicle of life; spirit is the form or
the interior vehicle which life assumes in order to express
itself. Realism, then, is life. Is the logician
dealing with reality when he collects and coördinates
the various modes of interpretation by which we learn
to understand the symbolism of life? Obviously not.
The data of logic are simply a collection of rules for
interpreting concepts. It is a compendium of indices
for the Book of Life. It is no more the book itself
than a table of contents is a book. But logic occupies
about the same category as does an index to a volume.
A book, however, is more than its conventional contents.
It is the thought that is symbolized therein.
The book of life, accordingly, is the sum total of
life's expressions; but it is not life itself. That is
the subtle, evasive something which the contents of
the book of life symbolize. Nature, both in her palpable
and impalpable aspects, may be said to be the
book of life wherein are recorded the movements, the
expressions, and the diacritics of life. The whole is
a magnitude of many facets (little faces). We shall
have to know all the faces before we can say that we
have a comprehensive knowledge of nature. For so
long as we have only a fragmentary knowledge of
the whole, so long even as we have merely a superficial
knowledge of any aspect of nature, just so long
will our knowledge be in vain. Just as it frequently
happens that, on account of the partial view of things,
we are led to make incorrect judgments concerning
them, so when we come to make assertions about life
or nature in general, we are apt to fall into the error
of rendering judgments upon insufficient data. And
it is not at all likely that judgments thus arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
can possess true validity because it may happen, and
undoubtedly does always so happen under the present
limitations of human knowledge, that the very elements
which are ignored or neglected in forming a judgment
possess enough of virtue to alter the intrinsic
value of determinations based upon otherwise insufficient
data. Hence it develops not infrequently that
our judgments repeatedly have to be changed in proportion
as our data are made more and more comprehensive.
Men searching eagerly for the truth
sometimes allow themselves to be carried away by the
enthusiasm of the moment which arises upon the discovery
of a new facet of truth; but if all searchers
were to bear in mind the fact that reality presents
itself to consciousness in myriad ways and that there
are innumerable facets all leading eventually back to
the source of all they not so easily would be induced
to jump to the conclusion that they had covered the
entire ground. For when we have discovered a million
facts, or many millions of them, about nature we
may say that we have only merely begun and that
what we have found is not to be compared with the
totality even of the directly observable phases of
nature.</p>

<p>Logic, therefore, deals with the symbolism existing
between and among facets of truth, and not
directly with truth itself, although the conclusions
reached by the logicians may be true enough from an
intrinsic standpoint. Logic is not truth, however; it
is merely the consistence of relations and inter-relations
between facts and among groups of facts. Truth
is not established by logic; it stands in no need of the
light of logic for its revelation; indeed, more apt than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
not is logic to obscure truth. Truth is its own proof;
it is self-evident. Logic is a mere modeler of facts;
it is static, immobile, fixed. All truly logical processes
need a starting point, a foundation, a premise, a base.
Truth, being eternal, mobile, dynamic, vital, needs
no starting point; needs no foundation because it is
itself fundamental; it requires no premise because no
premise is comprehensive enough to encompass it.
There is only one way of arriving at truth and that
is not to arrive at all&mdash;just to recognize it without
procedure. The fact that facts are, and the fact of
their relations and inter-relations, their sequence and
implications, can be arrived at only by logical processes.
Life, in its passage through the universum of
spatiality, carefully diacriticizes between the realm of
facts and the domain of truth, marking each off from
the other by unmistakable signs and barriers. Truth
is perceived as an axiomatic, self-evident principle and
no amount of logic could prove or establish its verity.
Facts are intellectual creatures; truth is intuitional,
vital. The intellect conceives the consistence of facts
while the intuition recognizes truth&mdash;is truth, and
therefore, follows in the wake of life as consciousness.</p>

<p>There is no permanence in facts and the intellectual
recognition of their consistence. The discovery
of a single new fact may destroy the consistence of
a whole mass of previously correlated facts. Thus
is revealed the miracle power of logic over facts. It
can take a mass of facts, related or unrelated, mold
them into hypotheses, endow them with a sort of interior
consistency, and make these hypotheses take the
posture of truth. Hence logic is often an effective
mask which the intellect commonly imposes upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
material; but it does so instinctively and can no more
escape the rigorous compulsion of this instinctive functioning
than water can escape its liquidity. Wherefore,
we conclude that true permanence abides alone
in truth because truth is duration itself. For the
foundations of the whole structure of facts in religion,
science, art and philosophy which man has toilfully
built up in the last million years might easily be destroyed
or overturned by the discovery of some great
fact or by appreciating the true value of truth. Let
us suppose it should suddenly be realized by men that
they are really and truly gods capable of creating and
possessing all the other virtues, powers and capabilities
which we are accustomed to impute to supreme divinity;
and suppose that the fact of their omnipotence
and divine omniscience always had been obvious but
that men were so engaged upon details and the non-essentials
of life and matter that they had not noticed
nor realized it before, would not this realization make
a vast difference in the character of our knowledge
and the attitude which we would necessarily assume
thereafter towards matter, life and the problems which
they present? Would not it completely revolutionize
our arts, our sciences and our philosophies? How
much, then, of the facts of these would be left when
the light of omniscience had been turned on&mdash;when
truth itself could be perceived and interiorly realized?
Not much, to be sure. We should undoubtedly have
to dispense with the entirety of our fact-mass, for it
should then be entirely useless and meaningless in the
light of the resplendent omniscience of truth. As at
present constituted consciousness is focused upon the
material plane for the purposes of superficial ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>servances.
But if the focus of consciousness should
be changed so as to reveal conditions upon what must
be a higher and more interior level, the aspect of
things would be entirely changed and the whole of
our theory of knowledge would have to be reconstituted.
It is conceivable, yea obvious, that the stern
reality of being is far removed into the Great Interior
of that which is; and there is a point in the path to
the interiority of being where there is no illusion, no
appearance, indeed, nothing but the cold, illuminating
body of reality itself. It must appear also that along
the journey interior-ward there are many apparent
levels or planes, each of which requires a new focus.
It is unreasonable, then, to suppose that the conclusions
arrived at as a result of purely logical processes,
confined to the lowest levels of reality, are pertinent
and valid for the entirety of realism which is neither
of mathematical nor logical import. For instance, if
we take the purely axiomatic assertion: <i>x</i> equals <i>x</i>,
the intellect is at once certain that this is so, and cannot
be otherwise, and yet a proposition of this kind
is purely conceptual, conventional and arbitrary. <i>x</i>
may also equal 1, 2, 3, 4, or any other quantity. Then,
if each <i>x</i> in the above equation be replaced, by
say, a horse, there immediately arises a difficulty. For
it is not possible to find two horses which are in all
respects mutually equal. So that as soon as we pass
from the conceptual into the actual, whether on the
side of objective reality or that of absolute reality, the
validity of the axiom is immediately exposed to
serious questioning. The truth of the matter is that
on both sides of the conceptual it is always found that
there is a variance from the standards set up by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
conceptual, this variance being more marked on the
side nearest to absolute reality than on the side of
objectivism. Objectively, the conformity of the sensible
with the conceptual is of such approximation as
to lend trustworthy utility to the conceptual in its
application to the sensuous. Thus by simply eliminating
the vital factors from our equations we are enabled
to proceed in a reasonably safe manner with
our judgments. Really, however, no such approximate
congruence can be found; for on the side of reality
we are dealing with an indivisible something&mdash;something
that is eternally and absolutely unitary in its
constitution while when we transfer the scene of our
observations to the objective world we discover a contrary
situation. Here we are everywhere beset by
diversities, multiplicities and dissimilarities. This is
so because the intellect naturally tends toward the objective
where it finds a most comfortable atmosphere
for its operations. The conceptual is related to the
objective as a train of cars is related to the railway.
That is to say, the constitution of the intellect is such
that it finds its most facile expression in the objective
world and is about as comfortable in the domain of
realism as the same train of cars would be on the
ocean.</p>

<p>The intellectuality is designed to deal with facets
of truth; it is made to manipulate segments, parts,
fractions, and cannot chart its way through a continuum
such as reality. Being constitutionally a conventionality
of the Thinker's own contrivance, and
arising out of the subtle adaptation of his vehicles
to the environment afforded by the sensuous world, it
can only find congruence in that conventionality which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
is the instrumentality of a higher intellectuality expressed
in a diversity of forms, into which reality
divides itself for manifestation. The human intellect
is, therefore, the bridge over which is made the passage
from the individual consciousness to the All-Consciousness;
simultaneously, the medium whereby
the physics of the brain are converted into the psychics
of unconsciousness. It may be likened to a pair of
specially constructed tongs which are so formed as
to fit exactly the objects which a higher intellectuality
has made. It is without the province of the intellect
to take note of what intervenes between physics and
psychics; it is always oblivious of interstices while
taking cognizance of objects or things. In this respect,
the intellect is much like a steerage passenger
on board an ocean liner who sees only his port of
departure and port of arrival, knowing nothing in the
meantime of what happens during the voyage, nothing
of what the other passengers on the upper decks may
experience and taking no part in any of the passing
show until he lands. So that the passage of the intellect
from fact to fact is an altogether uninteresting
voyage; it may as well be made unconsciously, and
to all intents and purposes, is so made.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the advocates of <i>n</i>-dimensionality
find it quite impossible to predicate anything whatsoever
of the passage, say, from tridimensionality to
quartodimensionality. They find themselves at ease in
tridimensionality and have even contrived to find
pleasant environs in the four-space having made
therein such idealized constructions as will afford
ample hospitality to the intellect. But the questions
as to how the passage from the three-space to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
four-space is to be made and how the intellect shall
demean itself during the passage have been completely
ignored and, therefore, left unanswered. What, then,
shall be said of an explorer who says he has found
a new land and yet can give no intimation as to how
one may proceed to arrive at the new land, what
changes are to be made en route, nor the slightest
suggestion as to the direction one should take in setting
out for it? It is not likely that the report of
such an explorer, in practical life, would be taken
seriously; and yet, there are those who, relying utterly
upon similar reports made by certain enthusiastic
analysts, dare to place credence in their asseverations.
Not only have they given wide credence to these reports,
but have, indeed, sought to rehabilitate their
own territory in accordance with the strange descriptions
given by unhappy analytical explorers. Now the
question of greatest concern, granting for the nonce
that there is such a domain as hyperspace, is the
<i>passage</i>. How shall we make the passage? Or, is
the passage possible? In vain do we interrogate the
analyst; for he does not know, nor does he confess
to know. Evidently it is impossible for him to know
by means of the intellect alone; for the intellect not
being fitted to take cognizance of the "passage," but
only the starts and stops, has no aptitude for such
questions. Hence, what seems to be the most important
phase of the entire question will have to remain
utterly inscrutable until the intellect nourished
by the intuition shall be aroused from its lethargy and
brought to a certain high point of illumination where
it, too, may take note of the passage.</p>

<p>Space is the path which life makes in its down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>ward
sweep through all the stages of pyknosis or
kosmic condensation by virtue of which it accomplishes
the engenderment of materiality as also the path
marked out by it in its upward swing whereby it accomplishes
the spiritualization of matter. It is the
kosmic order which life establishes by means of its
outgoings and incomings. When we look out into
space we perceive that which is a dynamic appearance
of life itself, and not a pure form. Nothing that is
a pure form can exist in nature and in as much as
space is not only indissoluble from nature but partakes
of its very essence it cannot be said to be a pure
form. The intellect, however, prone to follow the
grooves laid out by pure logic, never fails to seek
to make everything that it contacts conform to these
logical necessities. But, if the analyst were to make
careful discrimination as to the respective categories&mdash;that
into which life falls and that in which the intellect
is forced by its nature to proceed&mdash;he not so
easily would be led into the fault of attempting to
shape realities upon models which being strictly conventional
were not meant for such uses. But neither
the logician nor the mathematician can be condemned
for such generosity if such condemnation were justifiable.
For they everywhere and at all times insist
upon <i>realizing</i> abstractions and <i>abstractionizing</i> realities,
and they do this with an <i>insouciance</i> that is at
times surprising. Yet it is in this very vagary that
is discovered the true nature of the intellect. There
is a sort of dual tendence observed in the method of
the intellect's operation. A polarity is maintained
throughout: the abstractive and the concretional. It
vacillates continually between the abstract and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
concrete and no sooner has it found a concrete than
it begins to set up an abstract for it; and <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;as
soon as it is has constructed an abstract it immediately
seeks either its concrete or sets out to hew
some other concrete into such shape as will fit it.
And between these two extremes numerous excuses
are found for exercising this peculiar characteristic,
and that too, without regard to consequences. It
would seem that the intellect, in thus functioning, was
really engaged at a sort of sensuous play out of which
it derived an intense and not altogether unselfish
pleasure.</p>

<p>Of course, it must be granted that diversity has
its specific and withal necessary uses in that it affords
a field for the operation of human intellectuality and
represents the adaptation of the kosmic intellect to
the human for the purposes of evolution. This adaptation
while necessary for the intellectual development
is, however, not an end in itself. It is merely
a means to a higher purpose. In fact, if we regard
materiality as a deposit of life, carried by it as a kind
of impedimentum, and consciousness, which <i>is</i> life, as
being identical with the intellectuality which makes
these adaptations, there should be no grounds for the
statement that the one is adaptable to the other at
all. And as this is really the view which we assume
it would perhaps be more strict to regard the adaptation
as subsisting between the human intellect and
materiality both of which having been constructed by
kosmic intellectuality. Pursuant to the diversity of
uses to which materiality lends itself there arises in
the intellect a supreme tendency to segment, to break
up into separate parts, to multiply and diversify. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
is not content unless it is at this favorite and natural
pastime. It delights in taking a whole and dividing
it into innumerable parts. This it will do again and
again; because all its muscles, sinews and nerves are
molded in that mold and can no more cease in their
tendency to fragmentation than can the muscles of a
dancing mouse cease in their circular twirling of the
mouse's body. Yet, in this it is but creating a well-nigh
endless task for itself&mdash;which task must be performed
to the uttermost. But in its performance, that
is, in the intellect's complete understanding of the
diversity of parts, in the knowledge of their relations
and inter-relations and in their synthesis, it may arrive
at that one ineluctable something which is called <i>unity</i>.
And so doing, become ultimately free.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing, it is not surprising that
the intellect should have, finally, fallen upon the notion
of <i>n</i>-dimensionality. It has come to that as
naturally as it has performed its most common task.
Left alone and unhampered in its movements, it has
simply followed the lead of the Great Highway
through the domain of materiality. And now it has
arrived at a stage where it thinks it has succeeded in
fractionalizing space. Time has long ago yielded to
fragmentation, been divided into minute parts and each
part carefully measured. Space, not having a visible
indicator like time to denote its passage or parts,
suffered a long and tedious delay before it could boast
of a measurer. As the sun-dial measured time in the
past and became the forerunner of the modern clock
so <i>n</i>-dimensionality measures space for the mathematician.
What more practical instrument for this purpose
may yet be devised is not ours to prophesy; yet it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
not to be despaired of that some one shall find a suitable
means for this purpose. Seriously, however, it
is not without possibility that should some subtle mind
devise an instrument for marking the passage of space
as we have for denoting the passage of time a great
stride forward would be accomplished in the evolution
of the human intellect. For the general outcome
of the intellect's attention being turned to the <i>passage
of space</i> would undoubtedly be to recognize not only
its dynamism but its <i>becoming-ness</i>, as a process of
kosmogenesis. Because such an instrument would
have to be so constructed as to take note of the movement
of life, and for this reason, it would have to
be extremely sensitive necessarily and keyed to the
subtleties of vitality and not to materiality. Mathematics
shall have failed utterly in the utilitarian aspects
of this phase of its latest diversion if it do not justify
its claims by crowning its work in the field of hyperspace
with a "Kosmometer," an instrument devised
for the measurement of the movement of space or a
"Zoometer," an instrument devised for the measurement
of the passage of life. We should like to encourage
inventive minds to turn their attention life-ward
and space-ward with the end in view of constructing
such an instrument. When once we have
learned accurately to measure life we shall then be
able to dispose of it&mdash;to <i>create</i>. It is not doubted
that if ever humanity is to arrive at that point in its
evolution where it can understand life; if ever it is
to attain unto the supreme mastery both of vitality
and materiality and to come to the ultimate attainment
of divine consciousness (all of which we confidently
believe to be in store for humanity) it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
be accomplished after this manner: first, by syncretizing
materiality with vitality, and then, by intuitionally
recognizing the truth of the implications of the syncretism.</p>

<p>The history of consciousness in the human family
is identical with the history of man's conquest over
matter and physical forces. And this is clearly indicated
in the incidentals contingent upon the toilsome
rise of the <i>genus homo</i> from the earliest caveman
whose status denoted a comparatively negligible transcendence
of material forces, to the present-day man
who has gained a markedly notable conquest over
these forces. Always consciousness seeks the means
of adequately expressing itself in the sensible world.
And to this end it engenders faculties, organs and
processes in the bodily mechanism, and, in matter,
devises instruments of application whereupon and
wherewith it may test, analyze, combine and recombine
the forces and materials it finds. The unlimited
range of expressions lying open to the consciousness
makes it necessary continually to devise higher
and higher grades of appliances to meet its needs as
it expands. It will not be gainsaid that the telescope
has served actually to lay bare to the consciousness
an immeasurable realm of knowledge nor that the
microscope, turning its attention in an opposite direction,
marvelously has enlarged and enrichened our
knowledge of the world about us. And similar declaration
may be made anent almost every invention,
discovery and conquest which man has made over
natural phenomena. Thus, by externally applying
mechanical implements to the subject of his consciousness,
man has extended actually his consciousness, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
sphere of knowledge; has greatly enhanced its quality,
and, in the process, has urged the intellect to endeavors
that have wrought its present unequaled
mastery of things. Nor have the spiritual aspects of
our advance along these lines been the least notable.
For these have enjoyed the essence of all that has
been gained in the process and have, therefore, kept
pace with the onward movement of the intellectual
consciousness. But heretofore no advance has been
made as a result of methodic or reflexive determinations.
That is, men did not set out from the beginning,
equipped with foreknowledge of what their efforts
would bring, to develop the present quality of human
consciousness. They simply worked on, their attention
being absorbed by the problems that lay nearest
and demanded earliest consideration. So the advance
has come as a resultant of man's close application to
his ever-present needs&mdash;shelter, clothing, food, protection
and other preservative measures&mdash;and it has
come naturally and inevitably and without prepense.
Nevertheless, if man, knowing what to expect from
the syncretization of matter and mind, after this
fashion, should set out deliberately to accelerate the
intensification, expansion and growth of his consciousness,
there is no doubt but that the consequence would
be most far-reaching and satisfactory.</p>

<p>But the path that leads to this grand consummation
does not lie in the direction of diversity; it lies
in the opposite direction. In vain, then, does the
intellect fractionalize in the hope that by doing so it
shall come to the solid substructure of life; in vain
does the analyst segment space into any number of
parts or orders; in vain does he ask how many and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
how much; for by answering none of these queries
will he find the satisfaction which he vaguely seeks.</p>

<p>If it be true that it is not by analysis but by synthesis
that the true norm of life, and therefore, of
reality shall be found it is futile to entertain serious
hope of finding it in any other way. As a perisophism
or near-truth, then, <i>n</i>-dimensionality takes foremost
rank. And this is so for the reason that when we
proceed in the direction of multiple dimensions, that
is, one dimension piled upon another dimension or
inserted between two others we are traveling in a
direction which, the more we multiply our dimensions,
leads us farther and farther away from the truth.
This is a simple truism. If we take, for instance, a
wooden ball and cut it up into four quarters, and
divide each one of these quarters into eighths, into
sixteenths, thirty-seconds, sixty-fourths, etc., indefinitely,
we shall have a multiplicity of parts, each one
unlike the original ball. But from no examination of
the multipartite segments can we derive anything like
an adequate conception of the original ball. Something,
of course, can be learned, but not enough to
enable the rendering of a correct judgment as to the
nature, size, shape and general appearance of the ball.
But this is precisely what happens when the analyst
divides space into many dimensions. He cuts it up
into <i>n</i>-dimensional parts and the more minutely he
divides it into parts the more remote will each part
be in its similarity to the original shape and form of
space, and the farther away from the true conception
of the nature of space he is led thereby.</p>

<p>Now, <i>n</i>-dimensionality or that phase of metageometry
which regards space as being divisible into any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
number of dimensions or systems of coördinates is a
direct and inevitable product of that tendency of the
intellect to individuate and to singularize phenomena.
Biologically speaking, it is a peculiarity which harks
back to the time when life was manifested through
the cell-colony and when the individual cells began,
because of increasing consciousness, to detach themselves
from the colony and set out for themselves, and
thus each intellect recapitulates in its <i>modus vivendi</i>
the salient tendencies of phylogenesis. Let it suffice,
then, to point out that this universal tendency to segment
and fragmentate which rigorously characterizes
intellectual operations upon every phenomenon with
which it deals is a culmination of the primordial
tendency among cells to divide, inasmuch as this phase
of cell life must be the work of the kosmic intellect.
The natural inference is that from the extreme of individualization
there shall be a gradual turning,
whether of the intellect <i>per se</i> or of the intellect joined
to the intuition does not matter, towards that other
extreme of <i>communalization</i>. And from this latter
shall grow up, as one of the inevitable and ineluctable
tendencies of the Thinker's consciousness a torrentious
movement in human society towards coöperation,
brotherhood, mutuality and union in everything. So
that whereas in the past and at the present time the
intellect has been developing under the dominant note
of individuality it will then be coming gradually under
another dominant note&mdash;<i>communality</i>. The result of
this development will be the unification of all things,
and instead of many dimensions of space, many
measures of time, and a general diversification of all
phenomena, we shall come to the only true notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
these things and realize pragmatically the true value
and extent of unity in the universe.</p>

<p>It is admitted that the intellect, in treating objects
singly and dealing only with the starts and stops of
a movement, is withal loyal to the kosmic order, design
and purpose which have priorly characterized manifested
phenomena by segmentation. And in this loyalty
it has been following merely a natural lead which,
while admitting of the widest development and experience,
nevertheless at the same time beneficently
obscures the underlying reality in order that in its
adaptation to the sensuous world the intellect might
have the greatest freedom for the development suited
to the given stage of its evolution. But in thus admitting
the natural congruence between the intellectuality
and the phenomenal or sensuous we do not
thereby unite with those who already believe that this
kosmic agreement is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of psychogenesis.
On the other hand, it is maintained that this is merely
a phase of psychogenesis which shall be outgrown in
just the same measure as other phases have been outgrown.
And notwithstanding the fact that judgments
of the intellect with respect to inter-factual relations
or the ens of facts themselves are as valid as its judicial
determination of self-consciousness, no more and
no less, we are, by the very rigor and exclusiveness of
this logical necessity and inherent limitation, led to
view the intellect's interpretation of phenomena as
partial and fragmentary; for the reason that the necessitous
confinement of its understanding and interpretative
powers to fact-relations quite effectively inhibits
the use of these powers for the contemplation of the
deeper causative agencies which have operated to pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>duce
the phenomena. But it is apparent that just as
the transmuted results of other phases of psychogenesis
are now being utilized as a basis for the efficient
operation of the intellect in the sensuous world, thereby
enabling the attainment of a very high mastery over
matter, so will the functional dynamism acquired by
it in the pursuit and comprehension of diversity serve
well when, in later days, it has acquired the power
to deal directly with reality, to <i>create</i> and dispose of
life just as the kosmic intellect has and is now using
it in the execution of the infinite process of <i>becoming</i>
through which creation is proceeding. It would seem
that the necessary prerequisite to the development of
any higher functional capability is that the intellect
should be capable of disposing of innumerable details,
indeed the totality of kosmic detail, before it can
come wholly into the power and capacity to understand
and manipulate life. Furthermore, it appears
that the acquirement of this power quite necessarily
has been delayed awaiting that time when, dominated
by the intuition, the intellect shall have attained the
requisite managerial ability for marshaling an exceedingly
large number of details.</p>

<p>The supreme tendency of life is expression. And this
expression, singularly enough, reaches its most perfect
phenomenalization by means of that movement which
results in the multiplication of forms. Despite the fact,
therefore, that the comprehension of reality involves
a gradual turning away from the exclusive occupation
of organizing a multitude of separate and apparently
unrelated facts to a monistic view which at once
recognizes the unitariness and co-originality of all
things, of life, mind and form, the intellect will need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the training and development which come from the
mastery of diversity. It is, then, not difficult to perceive
the wise utilitarianism of the present schematism
of things as shown in the universal tendency in the
intellect to devote itself exclusively to parts or segments
of truth.</p>

<p>Whenever an individual intellectuality, on account
of prolonged thought and the consequent inurement
of the mind to higher and higher vibrations of the
kosmic intellect, brings itself to such a high point of
sensitiveness that it can receive so much as an intimation
of some great truth, it begins to sense, in a more
or less vague way, something of the substance and
general tendence of the underlying reality of that
which foreshadows its appearance. Then, confounded
by the multiformal characteristics of kosmic truth because
of the fact that it presents itself in such numerous
ways and forms, men often are induced to attempt
the reformation of all facts, or a great mass of
kindred facts, in accordance with the newly-found fact
or principle. They forget evidently that no fact in
the universe can be at variance with any other fact
and still be a fact. So that in the totality of facts
every separate and distinct fact must be congruent
with every other fact forming a beautiful, harmonious
and symmetrical whole; but often the whole is made
to suffer in the attempt at making it conform to the
substance of a mere intimation. Moreover, it is conceivable
that even the totality of facts may lack a
rigid conformity with reality in all its parts and that
having compassed the entire mass of facts one may
fall short of the understanding of realism.</p>

<p>This is practically what has happened in the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
of the metageometrician who having received an intimation
as to the real nature of space as that whose
center is everywhere and yet nowhere and whose
nature is psychological and vital rather than mathematical
and logical, misses the great outstanding facts
and clings to the intimations which he experiences as
to the nature of space. He, therefore, concludes that
the form of space is that of a flexure or curve.
There is a valid element in the notion of the curvature
of space but not enough of truth wholly to validate
the notion. Since the very reality of space is a matter
which can be determined only by the conformance of
the consciousness with it in such a manner as to render
the conception of it entirely unintelligible to the intellect
except in so far as it may be able to identify
itself with the space-process, there is much room for
the serious questioning of the mathematic conclusion
upon the grounds of its fragmentariness if not entirely
upon the basis of its invalidity. Wherefore it may
be seen that any search for either the center or the
extreme outer limits which proceeds in a manner conformable
to the external indications of the intellectual
order is vain, indeed. Although it is undoubtedly true
that the attainment of a central or frontier position
in space does not involve any lineal progression whatsoever,
the same being attainable, not by progression
nor by overcoming distances, but by a subtle adjustment,
yea, a sort of attachment of the consciousness
to the order of becoming which binds the appearance
of space, wherever one may be, it is nevertheless difficult
and painful for the intellect to grasp the totality
of this truth at one sweep. Indeed, it is not possible
for it, alone and unaided by the intuition, to grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
it at all. Hence, the mathematician who depends entirely
upon the deliveries of the intellect which conform,
in their passage from the conceptual to the
written or spoken word, to all the rigors of mathetic
requirements, fails utterly in perceiving the magnitude
of this conception and all its connotations; he fails
because his prejudices and the woof and warp of his
intellectual habits prevent his assuming a sympathetic
attitude toward it and thereby precluding at the start
any calm consideration of it. And not only is this
true of the mathematician but of all those whose endeavors
are confined to the plane of purely sensuous
and logical data. It would, therefore, appear that
our entire attitude towards things spatial must be
changed before we can even begin to perceive the
reality which is really the object of all researches in
this domain. But, on the surface, there is after all
little difference between the ultimate facts involved
in these two totally different conceptions. Mathematically
speaking, all progression eastward would
terminate at the west, and <i>vice versa</i>; and the same
would be true regardless of the point from which progression
might originate. Always the terminus would
be the opposite of the starting point. Then, too, it
might be said that if we sought the space-center we
should arrive at the circumference. The difficulty with
this view is that there is a very remote, though important,
connection between it and the truth of the
matter. But the partiality of this view, and the absence
of either experience or intuition to intimate a
more reasonable view, serve effectively to buttress it
as a hypothesis acceptable to many. Thus it is ever
more difficult to supplant a near-truth than it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
gain credence for the whole truth. On the other hand,
according to the view which we maintain here, it is
quite true that the seeking of the kosmic space-center
will reveal the circumference; that the search for the
nadir will uncover the zenith; the east effloresces as
the west, and a northward journey will wind up at
the south, etc., but in quite a different manner from
that which the mathematician has in mind when he
postulates the curvature of space. Our view involves
no space curvature nor any other spatial distortion.
<i>It deals with space as reality, as a dynamic process,
a flux which, like the sea, is continually casting itself
upon the shores of chaos and falling back upon itself
only to be recast against the rock-bound coast of its
chaotic limits.</i> Now, that which falls back upon itself
and rolls in a recurrent movement upon its own surface
is <i>life</i> which, in its recession is the natural and
kosmic limitations of itself, generates matter in all
its varied expressions. Space, in its extensity, cannot
transcend life; for it is the path which life makes in
its <i>out-coming</i>, its manifestation. Of the chaotic fringe
which circumscribes the manifested universe it is absurd
to say that it is vital or psychological in any
sense of these terms. For notwithstanding the fact
that out of its very substance are engendered life,
intellectuality, spatiality and materiality, it is nevertheless
none of these in its primary essence. It is
Chaos-Kosmos; because from its content the kosmos
is evolved, and it still remains; it is chaos-spatiality;
chaos-materiality; chaos-intellectuality; chaos-geometricity;
because these are engendered by the movement
of life in chaos while at the same time there remains
a residuum of the chaogenetic substance which consti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>tutes
the limitations of all these subsequent processes.
In this sense, the chaogenetic fringe becomes the limits
of the manifested universe so that it would appear
that all those major processes outlined above are finite
manifestations of the eternal chaos. But none of those
possibilities of motion which are found in these major
movements of the kosmos can be logically said to
exist in chaos. It is the embodiment of everything
that is the opposite of those qualities which may be
found in them, that is, in materiality, vitality, spatiality,
intellectuality and geometricity.</p>

<p>Apropos to this phase of the discussion let us
examine briefly one of its most significant implications,
both mathematical and kosmic, which arises out of the
fact that space is an engendered product of life that
is bound by the fringe of chaos which sustains and
limits it. The chaotic fringe plus manifesting kosmos
constitute the absolute magnitude of the kosmos. The
manifestation factor is complemented by the chaos
factor and together the two define the <i>full</i> universe.
Kosmogony is the universal movement of all kosmic
elements or factors in diminishing the chaotic complement
and reducing it to kosmic order or geometrism.
It is undoubtedly impossible to determine mathematically
the exact volume of either complement or
the ratio of the one to the other; yet it is conceivable
that the chaotic fringe is greater in extent than the
ordered portion of the kosmic uni-circle or universe.
It is even conceivable that the difference, upon the
basis of the meaning of the Pythagorean Tetragrammaton
and the view outlined in the Chapter on the
"Mystery of Space," is as seven to three wherefrom
the conclusion might be drawn that the universe has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
yet seven complete stages more or less of evolution
before the close of the Great Cycle of Manifestation
when the fringe of chaos shall have been totally used
up in the work of creation. But for those who may
experience impatience at the infinitude of the process
when viewed in this light the terms may be reversed
and the difference may be conceived as the ratio of
three to seven wherefrom the conclusion would follow
that the kosmogonic process is seven-tenths complete,
as it will not vary the seeming infinitude either
way it may be determined. The notion, despite its
speculative character, offers an explanation of otherwise
inexplicable conditions, and, on account of its
profound connotations, may even be found to be productive
of the highest good in its equilibrating influence
upon our mode of thinking.</p>

<p>In any event, there does appear to be a subtle
relation subsisting between true numbers and kosmogony.
Number is a phase of the kosmogonic movement,
a measurer of the intellect and the establisher
of the geometrism of space, answering tentatively to
the numericity of pure being. In fact, being actually
expresses number and number itself is an evolution
and not a thing posited once for all as a pure, invariable
form in the universe. It is, like the kosmos,
in a state of becoming and there may yet appear to
our cognitive powers a whole series of new numbers
pure in itself and altogether conformable to the conditions
reigning at the time.</p>

<p>The symbology of the circle, in all times recognized
as the true symbol of the kosmos in eternity,
of eternity itself, of the archetypal, of space, duration
and Ultimate Perfection, is replete with profound sig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>nifications.
But it should be understood that the
circle is a symbol of the <i>perfected universe</i> and not
the universe in a state of evolution. It symbolizes
perfection, completion and the ultimate union of the
manifesting with the archetypal which results in the
crowning deed of Perfection. The circle is, therefore,
not a symbol of the universe as it now stands; it does
not represent a snapshot view of the kosmos but the
universe as a <i>full</i>. It cannot be a <i>full</i> until it has
attained the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of completion; for a kosmic
full is that state to be attained by the manifested
kosmos upon the termination of all the fundamental
processes now in operation. But it is this state that
the circle really represents, and by virtue of which it
possesses its intrinsic qualities and also in virtue of
which the intellect recognizes these qualities. The
properties of understanding and recognizance in the
intellect are veritably fixed by the <i>status quo</i> of the
universe during every stage. That is, the focus of the
intellect, like the focus of a chromatic lens, is adjusted
by the fiat of the nature and eternal fitness of things
to correspond exactly with every state through which
the kosmos itself passes. This is one of the obvious
implications of the phanerobiogenic behavior of the
kosmos and is necessarily resident in the notion of
the genesis of space and intellectuality as consubstantial
and coördinate factors.</p>

<p><i>Wherefore the more cogent is the reason for the
belief that the inherent qualities of the kosmogonic
fundamentals; as, vitality, materiality, spatiality, intellectuality
and geometricity, are true variants, and
that their variability is proportional to the progress
of these major movements toward the ultimate satis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>faction
of the original creative impulse.</i> May it not
be, therefore, that the indeterminate character of
the ratio of the diameter to the circumference
(3.1415926 ...), is due to causes far more profound
than the crudity of our micrometers or the
mere supposed fact of the circle's peculiarity? May it
not also be true that the <i>pi proportion</i> shall become
a whole number, and in its integration, keep apace
with the perfecting process of the kosmos, diminishing,
by retrogression to one or increasing, by progression,
to ten which, after all, is essentially unity, being the
perfect numeral? It is not without the utmost assurance
that these queries will be categorically questioned
by the orthodox, creed-loyal, strictly intellectual
type that we sketch these implications, but it is
felt to be an urgent duty to remind all such that the
most effective barrier to realization in the field of
philosophy is an intolerant attitude towards all lines
of thought which suggest the impermanence of conditions
as we find them in the kosmos at the present
time. The fact is that our lives are so distressingly
short that we have neither time nor opportunity to
watch the changing moods of the kosmos nor discern
the gradual reduction of mere appearance to the firm
basis of reality, and accordingly, the intellect tenaciously
clings to those notions which it derives from
the instant-exposure which the lens of intellectual conceivability
allots to it. Once the view is taken it is
immediately invested with everlastingness. This
everlastingness is then imputed to the kosmos in that
particular pose, attitude or state. Always the intellect
beholds in that passing view, snatched from the
fleeting panorama of eternal duration, a picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
itself which it mistakes for the reality of the not-self.</p>

<p>The inclination of the axis of the earth toward
the plane of its orbit is approximately twenty-three
and one-half degrees. No well-informed astronomer,
however, doubts now the fact that this ecliptic angle
is being gradually lessened; because, as a result of
centuries of observation, it has been found to be decreasing
at the rate of about 46.3 seconds per century.
Yet no intellect is able to perceive in any given lifetime
the actual decrement of this angle. It is only
by careful measurements after centuries of waiting
that a difference can be discovered at all. Thus it
may even be so with the ratio of the diameter to
the circumference of a circle, the only difference being
that it has not yet been determined whether there is
a <i>decrement</i> or an <i>increase</i> in the size of the ratio.</p>

<p>The <i>pi</i> proportion is, then, a register or measurer
of the slow, measured approach of the manifesting
kosmos to the standard of ultimate perfection. Therefore,
and in view of these considerations, we may
not hesitate to confirm our belief in the validity of
the notion that it actually and literally expresses the
key to the evolutionary status of kosmogony. The
mathematical determination which limits it as an unchangeable,
inelastic quantity is, consequently, only
partially true and leads to the inclusion of this quantity
under the category of mathematical near-truths,
for such it appears to be in spite of its rigorous establishment.</p>

<p>The formal topography into which the intellect
spreads when seeking the ideal and the abstract is
not a condition which is derivable from the real essence
of life or matter, but, on the other hand, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
product of the intellect itself partaking of its nature
rather than of the nature of reality. There is, therefore,
a very important distinction to be made between
all deliveries of the intellect and the realism both of
the objects and conditions to which the intellectual
deliveries pertain. One of the most marked peculiarities
of the human intellect is the fact that it
always unavoidably stamps its own nature and features
upon every datum which passes through it to the consciousness.
The utmost importance attaches to this
phenomenon, for the reason that it points to the
necessity of carefully scrutinizing intellectual deliveries
and the making of allowances for those ever-present
characteristics which the intellect superimposes
upon its data. Perhaps the inherent colorific
quality which it imposes upon our knowledge would
be better understood if a similitude were indulged at
this juncture. The intellect may be likened to a
color-bearing instrument which, when it has once
handled an object, leaves forever its own color transfused
into every cell and fiber of the object so that
when the same object is presented to the consciousness
for purposes of cognition it bears always the same
peculiar marks and colorations which the intellect, in
its manipulation of it, places thereon. In this respect
the intellect may also be said to be like a potter who has
but one mold and that of a peculiar formation.
Hence, whatever wares it presents to the consciousness
will invariably be found to be molded in conformity
with that particular mold. If it were possible to view
reality or the essential nature of things the difficulty
which now the intellect lays in the path of direct and
uncolored cognition would be obviated; for then there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
no longer would be any necessity of viewing things
as they are colored or molded by the intellect. The
intuition, being a process of pure consciousness, will,
when it has arisen to a position where it may dominate
the intellect as the intellect now dominates it, so
modify this tendency which we see so ineradicably
bound up in the very nature of the intellect that the
apparently insurmountable difficulties which it has interposed
between mere perception and a direct cognitive
operation will be quite completely overcome.
Thus, in the above, is discovered another obstacle
which posits itself between the notion of space as
reality and the intellectual determination of it which
the mathematician examines and to which his consciousness
is necessarily limited. Furthermore, it may
be perceived also how easily the mind may be deluded
into thinking that the intellectual notion which it entertains
of space is necessarily correct, when obversely,
it is simply examining a concept which has been remade
by the intellect into a form which is not at all
unlike its own peculiar nature, and therefore, as much
short of reality as the intellect itself is. Similarly,
if the mathematical mind succeed in catching a glimpse
of the reality of space in the form of an intimation,
which, in itself though fragmentary, is nevertheless
true, its consciousness is finally deprived of the
true validity thereof simply because of the behavior
of the intellect in its manipulation of it. The importance
of these intellectual difficulties cannot be
over-estimated for they furnish the grounds for the
ineptitude of intellectual determinations made in a
sphere of motility to which the intellect is a stranger.
And this fact will appear more evident when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
perceived that quite the entire content of human
knowledge has been thoroughly vitiated by them. So
that only in those very rare moments which (in a
highly sensitive mentality) enable the intuition to gain
a momentary ascendancy over the intellect is it possible
for the Thinker to catch hold of realism itself,
and project the truth of what he sees into the lower,
intellectual consciousness. But so small is that portion
of our knowledge which owes its origin to the intuition
that when compared with the totality of that
which we seem to understand it is well-nigh negligible.
And then, when it is considered that at present there
is no way of conceptualizing adequately the intuitograph
so as to make it propagable the insignificance
of this form of knowledge is even more notable. It
can now be seen in how large a measure the notion
of the curvature of space is merely an intellectual
translation of a true intuition into the terms of the
intellect which, in the very nature of the case, can
only approximate the truth because of its colorific
habits.</p>

<p>A similar declaration may be made of that other
datum of metageometrical knowledge which postulates
the ultimate convergence of parallel lines. In fact,
what has been said as to the perisophical nature of
the notion of space-curvature will apply with equal
force to the idea of parallel convergence since the
latter is a derivative of the former. But there is yet
another consideration, apart from the colorific influence
of the intellect, which, although it partakes
of the nature of this quality, is nevertheless a near-truth
of quite a different order. This may be better
understood by referring to the <i>graph</i> showing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
inverse ratio of objective space to the consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Let us suppose that the <i>graph</i> may also
represent the Thinker's outlook into the world of
spatiality. It then appears that, because of that movement
of consciousness in its pursuit of life which, as
it expands, makes the objective world to appear to
be diminished in proportion to the extent of its expansion,
it is quite natural, under such circumstances,
that parallel lines drawn anywhere in the limits of
the objective world should seem to come to a point
in the ultimate extension of themselves. While this
<i>graph</i> is not meant to depict such a view, it may be
found nevertheless, to be a true delineation of the
topography of that state of mind into which the metageometrician
brings himself when he visualizes space
as <i>curved</i>; for there is no doubt but that a state of
intellectual ecstasy, such as that in which the mind of
the metageometrician must be functioning in order to
perceive space in that form, is quite different from
the normal and, therefore, in need of a different topographical
survey. But, if we grant that in the creational
aspects of space there is conceivable an ever-present
tendency to convolution, or a rolling back upon
itself, it is imaginable that parallel lines inscribed
either upon its surface or in its texture need not necessarily
meet but maintain their parallelism regardless
of the complexity of the convolutions. The convergence
of parallel lines is much like a tangent in
the outgrowth of the idea from the notion of space-curvature.
The more a tangential line is extended the
farther away from the circumference it becomes and
consequently less in agreement therewith. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
subsidiary propositions or corollaries are multiplied
the more remote from the truth the determinations
become and especially is this true of the hypothesis
of space curvature.</p>

<p>In the notion of the manifoldness of space, by
virtue of which it is conceived as existing in a series
of superimposable and generable manifolds of varying
degrees of complexity, are discernible traces of that
intuitional intimation which underlies the assertion
that because of the necessary phenomenalization of
reality for the purpose of manifestation to the intellect
it appears to exist in a series of separate degrees,
each one more refined and subtle than the preceding
one and requiring a more highly developed species of
consciousness for its comprehension. In other words,
that intuitional glimpse of the essential character of
reality, as viewed by the human consciousness, which
impinged upon the minds of <span class="smcap">Riemann</span> and <span class="smcap">Beltrami</span>
leading them to postulate as a corollary proposition
to space-curvature, its manifoldness, is nothing more
nor less than the intuition that the universum of spatiality
cannot otherwise present itself to the intellect,
owing to its peculiar adaptation to the sensuous, except
by a series of continuous degrees which are perceptible
only in proportion as the understanding is
magnified to conform with it. After all, however, it
is not improbable that the very objectivism of the
universe in manifestation subsists in just the manner
in which this intuitive glimpse implies and that the
wisdom and utilitariness of the kosmogonic process
which engendered spatiality are clearly demonstrated
in that arrangement of the contents of the kosmos
which presents the grossest elements of phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
first to the intellect in its most impotent state while
reserving the less crass for that time when the
Thinker shall have evolved a cognitive organ adaptable
to its presentations. Those metageometricians
who cling to the idea of the manifoldness of space,
based as we have shown upon the pseudo-interpretation
of a rather vague hint arising out of an unquestionably
true intuition, have allowed themselves to fall into the
unconscious error of magnifying the importance of
the mere insinuation as to the space-nature to such an
extent as wholly to obscure in their own minds and
in the minds of those who think after them whatever
of the true vision that may have been grasped by
them. Furthermore, it is indubitably true that that
same peculiarity of arrangement by which impalpable
and invisible forces really subtend gross matter producing
that subtle schematism in virtue of which the
visible is subjoined to the invisible, the sensuous to
the non-sensuous, spirit to matter, etc., also characterizes
the appearance of spatiality to the human
understanding. While there is a superficial semblance
of separate and discrete manifolds into which space
may be divided there are, in reality, no such sharp
lines of demarkation between the subtle and the
gross, between the visible and the invisible or between
spirit and matter, each of these being capable of reduction,
by insensible degrees, into the other regardless
as to whether the reductional process originates
on the side of the most refined or on that of the
grossest. Accordingly, there are no reasonable
grounds upon which the notion of a space-manifold
may be justified except as a metageometrical near-truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, there are yet other
very fundamental considerations which would seem
to debar the totality of analytical conclusions as to
the nature of space from any claim to ultimate reliability
and trustworthiness. These are <i>first</i>: the fact
that analyses are absolutely incapable of dealing with
life; that being the direct product of a sort of
mechanical consistency which marks the intellectual
operations it has adaptability only for dealing with
fragments or disconnected parts, and that without any
reference whatsoever to the current of life or the
flow of reality which has produced the parts. This
fact is clearly shown in that attitude of the understanding
which inevitably leads it to the declaration
that a line is an infinite series of points, a plane an
infinite series of lines, and a cube, an infinite series of
planes, and so on, indefinitely. To do this, to look
upon all phenomena as a series of parts similar to
each other and piled, one upon the other, or juxtaposed
in the manner which they are discovered in the sensible
world, is the natural tendency of the intellect
and this tendency finds its most facile expression in
analytics. Inadaptability of this sort is especially observable
in all problems of arithmetical analysis in
which the vital element is a factor. When these
analyses are carried to their logical conclusion, as has
been shown in the chapter on "The Fourth Dimension,"
invariably they end in an evident absurdity.
But it is at their very conclusion where the life-element
is encountered, where reality is approached, that they
break down. The failure of analysis, then, to encompass
life, to fit into its requirements and to satisfy
its natural outcome seems clearly to establish the basis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
of the perisophical nature of the entirety of analytical
claims, especially that species of analysis which seeks
the remoter fields of the conceptual for its determinations.
<i>Second</i>: the close connection which has been
seen to subsist between space and life as joint products
of the same movement makes it obvious that the same
ultimate rule of interpretation must be applied to
both in order to insure correct and dependable judgments
regarding them. How different would be the intellectual
attitude towards space if it were considered
in the same light as vitality, provided one really understood
anything about vitality! Moreover, as it
appears certain that the path of the intellect does not
run in the same direction as the path which life makes,
but in an inverse direction, it is clear that the judgments
of the former, as to the action and essence of
the latter, must necessarily be ultimately unreliable.
It can readily be seen, however, that should the intellect
be focused so as to follow the path of life, to
attach itself to the very stream of life, it would have
necessarily to neglect materiality. And such an adjustment
would, of course, obviate the need of a
material life at all for humanity. In fact, a physical
life with an intellect would be impossible under such
conditions. It is well to recognize the suitability of
the present schematism and not to become unwisely
restive because of it; but it is also fitting that we should
discriminate between that which is possible for the
intellect chained to materiality and that which is impossible
for it, in such a state, when foraying in a territory
foreign to its nature, and beyond its powers to master.</p>

<p>The predominating tendency in the intellect to
account for the universe of life, mind and matter upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
a strictly mechanical basis is undoubtedly due to the
constitution of the intellect which does not admit of
its direct consideration of the vital essence of things.
We are bound ineluctably to the surface of things.
All our knowledge is therefore superficial. We are
even bound to the surface of ideas, and cannot penetrate
to the interior of these realities. Our art is the
reproductions of superfices; our philosophies are the
husks of eternalities; our religions, the habiliments of
relations, and while it cannot be doubted that this
arrangement is pre-eminently the best possible one for
the present stage of man's evolution, it is nevertheless
worth while to note that it is this very restricted
activity of the intellect which shuts out from man's
consciousness those very elements about which he is
most concerned when he goes into the field of philosophy
in search of a solution to his unanswerable
queries. But some progress most surely is made when
the mind is enabled to see its plight and recognize what
are the difficulties and limitations that lie in its path
of ultimate attainment.</p>

<p>It is believed that the mechanistic, or true, character
of the intellect reached its zenith in the mind of
<span class="smcap">Lagrange</span> when he succeeded in reducing the entirety
of physics to certain mechanical laws and formulæ
which he embodied in his "<i>Mecanique Analytique</i>"
This work is undoubtedly the capstone of intellectual
endeavors and stands as a monument which marks
the culmination of the present stage of intellectual
development. In thus placing the <i>Mecanique</i> at the
apex of intellectual endeavors it is not thereby meant
to be implied that the intellect shall not make more
progress nor that other formulæ, equally as marvel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>ous
as those which <span class="smcap">Lagrange</span> discovered, may be
devised, nor that other laws, heretofore undreamed
of, may be found; but what is maintained is the fact
that while there will be growth and development these
will run along other channels, perhaps in the realm
of the intuitable, and not any longer, especially so
notably as now, in an opposite direction against the
current of life and reality; and further, that there
will be a gradual turning away from mechanics to
biogenetics, from diversity to unity, from the purely
intellectual to the intuitional, and withal a final getting
rid of the bonds of illusion, of that thralldom of
mechanics, whereupon will slowly arise the obsolescence
of all those disparities which may now be
recognized in our knowledge and in the applications
of the intellect to the data of the objective world.</p>

<p>Because the intellect is unsuited to deal with reality,
and because of its peculiar adaptation for diversity,
for multiplicity, due to its mechanistic <i>modus vivendi</i>,
there has grown up a voluminous catalogue of systems
of philosophy. These embody such a multitudinous
array of beliefs, ideas, conceptions, theories and conjectures
and constitute a movement in human thought
which oscillates between the empiricist on the one
hand and the transcendentalist on the other; between
the idealist and the realist, leaning sometimes towards
the Platonic, the Cartesian and the Kantian and at
other times towards <span class="smcap">Spinoza</span>, <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, <span class="smcap">Spencer</span>
and <span class="smcap">Socrates</span>, always terminating by multiplying the
number of diverse beliefs rather than unifying them
that the conclusion is unavoidable that so marked a
lack of unanimity is indicative of a profound mental
prestriction. It was, therefore, inevitable that mathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>matics
should fall under the same spell and brook
no let nor hindrance until it had succeeded in devising
several diverse systems of geometry which it has done
for the mere joy of doing something, of following its
instinctive aptitudes. There is no other basis for the
heterogeneity of our philosophies, our mathematics,
indeed our beliefs than this mechanical, and hence,
radically illusionary character of the intellect in consequence
of which we have had to be satisfied with
mere glimpses, hints, intimations and faint glimmerings
of reality, of life, and of those kosmic movements
which, if we had the ability to trace them from their
source outward, would lead us unerringly to a truer
and deeper knowledge of those things that under the
present schematism must remain for us a closed book.</p>

<p>The criterion of truth for us, constituted as we
are and wedged in between the stream of life and its
shore of materiality, must be that which relates our
knowledge both to the stream and to the shore. It
must be so that all predicates which purport to approach
it shall exhibit a dual reference&mdash;one that relates
to materiality and another that relates to vitality,
and yet a third that shall combine these two relations
into one. All assertions, therefore, which pertain exclusively
to either of these elements&mdash;to materiality
or to life&mdash;are necessarily partial, fragmentary and
perisophical in nature. Mathematics, because it relates
to matter and the mechanical forces set up by
matter acting against matter cannot be said to agree
with such a criterion; art, because it relates to snapshots
or static views of matter is even more remote
in its agreement; philosophy, as it has been known in
the past and is known to-day, because it seeks to deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
with a vitality fashioned after the image of materiality
has failed when posited alongside of this
criterion; and thus, the intellectual toil of millions of
years has been in vain in so far as it has not succeeded
even in raising a corner of the cover which hides
reality from our view.</p>

<p>A near-truth is any variation from this standard,
this norm or criterion. It may be either logical,
cognitive, scientific or even metaphysical. To define:
a logical truth is a predicate based upon and involving
the coherency and consistency of thoughts themselves;
a cognitive truth is the conformity of knowledge with
so much of reality as is known; scientific truth is the
conformity of thoughts to things and conditions. All
of these are obviously near-truths. Then, too, a near-truth
may be defined as an assertion based upon the
criterion of truth but falling within the category of
cognitive truths owing to insufficiency of data or vision.
Such indeed are those metageometrical predicates&mdash;<i>n</i>-dimensionality,
space-flexure, space-manifoldness and
all other assertions based upon these in general and
specifically. Any recognition of truth must clearly
embrace both the vital and material aspects of its
subject in order to be adequately inclusive, that is, it
should include the causative, the sustentative, the relational
and the developmental factors. These four
factors are considered necessary and sufficient to determine
the conformity of any view to the criterion of
truth for when we are cognizant of the cause of a
subject, understand the sustentative factors which keep
it in existence, are conversant with its relations to other
subjects and can follow its developmental variations
until we come to its final status, why then, our knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>edge
is both sufficient and ultimate so far as that
subject is concerned. Is it asking too much of mathematics
or of philosophy or any system of thought that
it conform to these standards or to this criterion before
we shall accept it as final? Or shall we be satisfied
with less than this? Let us hope not.</p>

<p>In the foregoing presentation stress has been
placed upon the fragmentary, and therefore, illusionary
character of the intellect in order to arrive at an
understanding of the difficulties under which real
knowledge has to be acquired and to indicate the inanity
of all attempts to resolve the riddle of space
by means of mathematics though regarded as the most
typical exemplification of the mechanistic nature of
the intellect. And further, to show that, on account
of the radical incongruity which estranges life, the
producer of spatiality, from the intellect which returns
again to scrutinize the passage of life in its outward
expressions, no hope of ever gaining the true viewpoint
by means of the intellect need be entertained.
But in doing so, it is deemed fitting that a note of
warning should be sounded against any abortive attempts
that may be made to obscure or distort the
results of such a close discrimination lest the true
import of the examination be lost for, if we emphasize
the vanity of the intellect in the pursuit of that which
it is by nature unsuited to attain we also equally stress
the wise utilitarianism which limits it to the performance
of the tasks assigned while at the same time
reserving for the function of more highly evolved
powers, and indeed, for the intuition itself, the solution
of the riddle of spatiality. And if we declare the
futility of the mathematical method in all endeavors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
aimed at unveiling the mysteries of life and mind, and
of that movement which has its roots set in eternal
duration from which it proceeds in an endless continuity
of purpose and promise, we do also recognize
that in the science of mathematics the intellect shall,
as in no other method of cognition, most fully fulfill
the kosmic intent of its existence; and moreover, in
the pursuit thereof it shall push the frontiers of its
possibilities outward until it can be said almost to be
able to make disposition of life itself&mdash;at least to
that point where, when the intuition shall have come
into its own, the passage from the mechanics of matter
to the dynamics of life, shall be comparatively easy
and natural.</p>

<p>Evolution is a continuous process and the primal
impetus back of the great on-flowing ocean of life acts
infinitively. It is not terminated when life has succeeded
in perfecting a form for the perfection of
forms in themselves is not the end of vital activity.
<i>The end of evolution is the complete spiritualization
of matter.</i> So that it does not matter how perfect
a form may be either subjectively or in its adaptation
to environments; it does not matter how faultless a
medium for the ensouling life it may be, there is ever
the eternal necessity that life must drive it back over
the path of its genesis until it shall be transmuted into
pure spirit. Adaptation succeeds adaptation and with
each there is a change in the form and this process
continues until there is a more or less perfect con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>gruence
between form and juxtaposed environmental
conditions. But no sooner than agreement has been
attained under one set of conditions new conditions
arise and require a new setting, new adaptative movements.
Thus there is a continuous proceeding from
stage to stage, going from the grossest to the subtlest
and most refined, always the form is being pushed
onward and upward by life. But adaptation is not
undergone for the benefit of the form, but more truly
for the informing principle. It is the progression of
the life-element which constitutes the adaptation of
form to form and to their peculiar environs. The
form is a tool or instrument of life which it discards
the moment it fails to respond to its requirements.
Thus forms are constantly being assumed and as constantly
being relinquished. But no effort of life is lost
regardless as to whether the action is performed in
one or another form. The totality of matter is perpetually
being acted upon by the totality of life. Every
appulse of life against matter means an added push
in the direction of spiritualization. The totality of
such appulses of life against matter may seem infinitely
small in the visible results which they produce in the
process of spiritualization; but with each there is an
eternal gain in that movement that shall end in the
complete transmutation of materiality into spirituality.
This action of life in metamorphosing matter, the
nether pole of the great pair of opposites, into spirituality,
its copolar factor, in its outward, visible effects,
is what we vaguely call evolution. And such it is;
for life is merely unfolding that which it has enfolded.
Matter, having been involved as a phase of kosmic
involution, is now being evolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>In the genesis of the kosmos there appear to be
three great undulations in the universal current of life.
The first of these prepares the field by depositing that
elemental essence which is to become the world-plasm;
the second precipitates the universum of materiality,
spatiality and intellectuality, not as we now know
them, of course, but as potencies; the third great undulation
in the current of life effects the endowment
of the world-plasm with those tendencies that are to
build around themselves forms appropriate to their
fulfillment. This ensoulment of the world-plasm with
tendencies and the consequent segmentation of it into
separate forms by these tendencies constitute the
primary stages of that procedure of life which results
ultimately in the up-raisement of matter and its final
exaltation into pure spirit. Hence, the entire mass of
materiality is besieged on all sides by the sum-total
of life and the former is being raised slowly and
irresistibly to heights that are immeasurably more sublime
than its present degree of grossness.</p>

<p>It appears paradoxical, therefore, that life, although
in all respects vastly superior to matter, should
become the apparent vassal of materiality and give
itself up to all the strict rules of imprisonment which
are imposed upon it by the properties and qualities
which we observe in matter. It seems so subject
to every whim and fancy of matter that one is inclined
to think that matter and not life is the chief
designer of universal destiny. This is not a condition
to be wondered at so much, for the reason
that this apparent vassalage, this seeming enslavement
of life by matter, is due to that superior and
most marvelous adaptability of life which it enjoys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
in contradistinction to the relative unpliability of
matter, and due also to the fact that life is kinetic and
matter, being a mere deposit of life, is static. Life
is mobility while matter is immobility and thus in
possessing a greater range of freedom is, of course,
correspondingly superior; but in this adaptation of
itself to the labyrinthine cavities and multiformed interstices
in matter it exhibits but a seeming serfdom
which is really not a serfdom but a mastery. It is
as if a man had taken lumber, hardware and stone
and built a house wherein he might dwell&mdash;life has
merely used matter, molded and fashioned it so as
to make for itself a medium, a dwelling-place wherein
it operates, not as a slave but as a master possessing
unlimited freedom of motility. In the production of
a form life stamps upon it, once for all time, the path
of its engendering action. It leaves its finger-prints
upon the mold which it makes for itself. So that if
we would know where life <i>has been</i> or where it <i>is</i> we
should look for its finger-prints (organization); we
should observe the sinuosities which mark its pathway,
remembering always that it is life that has formed
the intricacies and complexities of the form into which
it pours itself so accommodatingly in order that it may
raise that form, develop and transmute it into something
higher and better.</p>

<p>When we speak of <i>form</i> it must not be understood
thereby that reference is made only to the gross
physical form, but to the entire range of vital assumptions
or vehicles which life ensouls for purposes of
manifestation. This range we believe to cover the
whole path of kosmogenesis seriating from the densest
to the most subtle. Our chief concern, however, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the immediate effect which the totality of life's operations
will have upon humanity or the form which it
ensouls as the human organism. For it is impossible
that humanity shall escape either the general or the
specific results of the exalting power which life exerts
over materiality and its appurtenances. It is, of
course, impossible here to go into the various implications
of this general forward movement of the universum
of materiality or even to outline briefly the
divergent lines of operation into which a satisfactory
exposition of this view would naturally lead. And
then to do so would be inappropriate in a volume of
this kind. So we shall have to be content at this
juncture to limit our study to a consideration of what
we believe to be some of the immediate indications of
this vast and most far-reaching phenomenon.</p>

<p>In the chapter on the "Genesis and Nature of
Space" it is shown that the material universe is engendered
at the same time and by the same movement
or process as the universum of spatiality and
intellectuality and that as the passage from chaos to
kosmos proceeds the function of this movement is
changed gradually from engenderment to exaltation
wherein materiality is transmuted into spirituality. It
is, of course, obvious that as materiality is exalted
so are spatiality and intellectuality; and that as the
one becomes more and more refined, capable of answering
to higher and yet higher requirements so do
all the others. For, at work in all and through all of
these, is the current of life which pervades them, engendering,
sustaining and elevating as it proceeds.
So that as matter has evolved added characteristics
and properties, each answering to a given need and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
arising out of the necessities inhering in the stage at
which it appeared, so has the intellect evolved faculties
to correspond therewith. In other words, the evolution
of faculties for the expression of the human
intellect has proceeded synchronously with the evolution
of material qualities. And whenever a new
faculty or an additional scope of motility is achieved
by humanity there is always found a set of kosmic
conditions which answers thereto. The cardinal principles
of the doctrine of evolution are not, therefore,
adverse to the conclusion that the organs of sense-perception&mdash;hearing,
touch, sight, taste and smell&mdash;have
not been endowed upon the human race or attained
by it at one time; but rather that each answering
to a newly acquired need and opening a wider
scope of motility for the intellect has been evolved
separately and in due order. It would also seem that
the quality of consciousness, as it has been manifested
in the various stages of life through which it has passed,
and especially the mineral, vegetal and lower animal,
has not always been of the same degree of efficiency.
Nor has it enjoyed the same kind of freedom which
it now enjoys in the highly evolved <i>genus homo</i>. It
is equally apparent that matter itself has not always
been in possession of the same qualities and characteristics
which it now exhibits; but that it, too, has
gone through various stages of evolution bringing
forward into each new stage the transmuted results of
each preceding one as a basis for further evolution
and expansion. The innumerable archæological evidences
which support this view make it unnecessary
to do more than state the facts, as they appear to
be substantiated by indubitable testimonies. Further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>more,
it is believed that the outstanding implications
of these phenomena will not be successfully controverted
by those who are disinclined to see such implications
in the evolutionary process. In a previous
chapter we have briefly sketched the characteristics
which mark the upspringing of a new faculty showing
how, at first, it appears as an abnormality which exhibits
itself in a very few individuals only, and that
in a more or less indefinite manner; and how later
the number of individuals in which it appears gradually
increases, the definiteness of the faculty, at the same
time, appearing more marked; then, like a tidal wave,
it recurs in a still larger number of persons until, at
last after a long period of time usually several thousands
of years, it becomes universal exhibiting itself
in every individual and appearing as a hereditary
characteristic of the entire human race. It is, therefore,
not without assurance as to the ultimate soundness
of this view that we make the assertions which
follow this brief introduction.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that for a very obvious
reason, namely, the satisfaction of the needs of our
present humanity, the intuition is for the time dominated
by the intellect and held in subjugation by it so
that all of man's external operations are governed
and dictated almost entirely by the intellectuality, allowing
the intuition only rare moments when it can
come to the fore at all. This is the rule in the evolution
of faculties and characteristics. The higher
faculty, although potentially present in every way, is
ever held in abeyance while the lower is brought, under
the rigors of its own evolution, to a point where its
joint operation with the higher may be executed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the least possible friction and retardation as also with
the greatest possible coördination and coöperation.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the fact that materiality
must possess in potentiality all the qualities which it
will at any time reveal, it is nevertheless necessary that
these qualities shall come forth gradually and in due
order. Similarly, humanity has come into possession
of its various faculties of mind, and powers of physiological
functions, by insensible degrees, the higher
always being held in abeyance until the lower is fully
developed. Those faculties which are to bestow
added powers, additional freedom and a greater scope
of motility are the ones which appear later than those
which are truly primitive in character. These facts
have been amply demonstrated by the science of embryology
wherein it is shown that <i>ontogeny</i> is a recapitulation
of <i>phylogeny</i>. That is, the history of the
development of the individual is a recapitulation of the
development of the species. Thus the various stages
of development through which the human embryo
passes while <i>in utero</i> are but a repetition of similar
stages through which the entire human species has
passed in its phylogenetic development. Wherefore,
it is certain that humanity has not attained, at one and
the same time, all the powers of mind and body which
it now possesses; that the childhood of the human race
represented a time when it had but few faculties or
organs of sense-perception&mdash;indeed a time when the
higher sense-organs of smell, taste and sight were
entirely lacking although residing in potentiality
therein.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that the earth has passed
through a similar evolution with respect to its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
material characteristics, that its childhood was, in all
points, analogous to the childhood of humanity; that
the air, earth and water were wholly absent, except
in potentiality, during the nebulous youth of its genesis.
It is even probable that there are at work to-day
processes which in the future shall culminate in the
evolution of newer, higher and more complicately organized
species of plants, animals and minerals. Every
year brings fresh evidences that crystallize the conviction
that the earth has been the scene for the appearance
of many strange orders of animal life.
Fossiliferous strata are continually yielding incontestable
testimonies of changing flora and fauna. We
count the animal and vegetal life of to-day as being
more highly developed than that of any other previous
age, and it is well that this is so, for simplicity of
organization and primality of manifestation are always
succeeded by complexity and a greater scope of
adaptability.</p>

<p>We have said that the whole of that movement
of the intellect which has brought forth the metageometrical
creations of hyperspaces, the curvature of
space and its manifoldness together with the entire
assemblage of mathetic contrivances are merely the
early evidences of the appearance in the human race
of a new faculty, a new medium of perception whereby
the Thinker shall acquire a still greater range of
motility than that now offered by the intellect. Attention
has been called also to the fact that this phenomenon
has been manifested not alone in the field of
mathematics, but in art, religion, politics and also in
science in which we have only to witness the marvelous
strides already made in the discovery of radio-active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
substances, the <span class="smcap">Roentgen</span>, <span class="smcap">Becquerel</span>, <span class="smcap">Leonard</span>
and other kinds of rays. It Is quite confidently believed
that these forward movements in every branch
of intellectual pursuit, these combined efforts of the
intellect, in peering into the occult side of material
things, are in response to the evolutionary needs of
the Thinker, and in addition, are the evidences, and
shall in time be the cause, of the development of an
additional set of faculties. Function, or the performance
of acts, determines faculty or the power of action
and ultimately the organ itself. Thus the mere wish
to perform aroused by desire and vitalized by the
will actually terminates, in the course of time, in the
genesis of a faculty, or the power to perform. The
constant upreaching yearnings of the Thinker through
his intellect for greater freedom and a larger scope
of action, the desire to peer into the mysteries of life
and mind, the infantile out-feelings of the mentality
after some safer and surer basis for its theory of
knowledge cannot fail in producing not only the
faculty or power to satisfy these cravings but the very
organ or medium by virtue of which the satisfaction
may be attained.</p>

<p>It is not strange that in mathematics the intellect
should have found first the clue to the existence of
a higher sphere of intellectual research wherein it
might become the creator of the various entities which
peopled the new found domain; it is not strange that
the mathematician should, in this instance, have assumed
the role of the prophet proclaiming by various
mathetic contrivances (although unconsciously) that
the human race is nearing that time when it shall
actually be able to function consciously in some higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
sphere; neither is it to be wondered at that the voice
of the prophet is heard and respected throughout the
earth; for, indeed the mathematician is a spokesman
who, as a rule, is unmoved by sudden outbursts of
passion and ecstatic frenzies of emotions but calmly
and dispassionately verifies his conclusions, tests them
for consistency and having found them to satisfy the
most rigorous mathetic requirements hesitates not to
propound them. For this cause humanity respects the
mathematician, and when he speaks listens to his voice.
It is well, too, that this is so; for the history of mathematics
is clearly the history of the development of
the intellect. So exact a determinator of the quality
of intellectual efficiency is it that its reign may be
said to be an absolute monarchism whose lines of
dominance extend to the minutest desire or appetency.
It has always been the guide of the intellect, going
before, as it were, blazing the trail, pushing back the
frontiers of the intellect's domain and clearing away
the <i>debris</i> so that the intellect with its retinue of
servitors might have an easy path of progress.</p>

<p>Mathematics, however, has not the aptitude to
serve the intuition as it serves the intellect. So the
path into which the intuition would lead humanity the
mathematician, because of his training and peculiar
functions, is unprepared to enter. It is for this reason
that when mathematics leads the intellect up to that
point where it encounters life it fails, it becomes
confused and its dictatorship becomes a mockery, its
decrees remain unexecuted and futile. In taking this
view we have certainly no desire to offend the mathematician
or to detract from the glory of his monarchistic
rulership over the intellectual progress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
race; for, in truth, mathematics is the diadem of gold
wherewith man has crowned his intellect. Yet it is
well, yea imperative in the light of recent developments
in the realm of hyperspace, that a careful discrimination
should be made as between the sphere of the
intellect and that to which the intuition shall attain.</p>

<p>The intuition, long held in abeyance until the intellect
should be fully crowned and reach the zenith
of its powers, is now coming to the front. It will be
many centuries perhaps before it shall have grown to
such proportions as those already attained by the intellect;
perhaps a few thousand years may pass before
the intuition shall have evolved to that point where
it may labor as coadjutor to the intellect; but undoubtedly
the time will come when it, too, shall reward
the Thinker's labors with that which shall be more
precious than the crown of gold which the intellect
has won. Then, the intellect, grown old and decrepit
with years of reigning shall become dim and crystal-shaped
and finally pass into automatism or reflexive
movements where without the urge of volitional impulses
it will perform with exactness, precision and
utter loyalty the tasks which it has learned so well
to execute in the days of its forgotten glory. Mankind
will then be free. A new freedom, wherein the
erstwhile lightning flashes of intuition will become
fused into one glorious sheen of all-revealing light,
shall come to men and thus the race resplendent will
walk the earth enshrined in the majesty of divine
powers attained as a result of millions of years of
aspiration.</p>

<p>That there are supersensuous realms so far above
the range of our senses as to be entirely beyond their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
ken needs now no proof or argument; for the scientist
has demonstrated, by the invention of instruments of
extreme delicacy and precision, that such a world
does really exist. Already we know of stars so distant
that, though light traverses in the brief space of
an hour six hundred million miles, they might have
ceased to shine before the pyramids were built and
yet be visible to us in the skies. If the human eye
were as sensitive as the spectroscope many thousand
tints and shades might be added to the world of
color; if they possessed the magnifying powers of the
microscope we should live in constant terror and awe
of the monstrous entities that teem in the water which
we drink and in the air which we breathe; and if our
ears could detect the microphonic vibrations which
register in the delicate apparatus of some microphones
the dead, vacuum-stillness of nature's great silences
would appear as a babel of voices by the seaside.
The sense of touch, responding to the same range of
vibrations as the micrometer, would reveal actually the
interstices between particles of the densest elements;
and gold, silver, platinum and mercury would seem
but honeycombs of matter. But, to the forward-looking
there is no element of absurdity in the expectation
that all these senses shall, one day, be able
to dispense with the artificial aid of physical apparatus
and perform, with even greater precision and
faithfulness, the task which they now perform so
crudely and ineffectively. There are without doubt
vibrations of taste and smell which are so far above
the range of these senses that they have no effect upon
them whatsoever. Notwithstanding the fact, however,
that the galvanometer, microscope, the microphone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the spectroscope and the telescope have extended thus
the sphere of sense-knowledge there are yet subtler
vibrations to which these delicate instruments do not
and ought not be expected to respond. But to say,
as do many empiricists, that since these phenomena
cannot be detected by scientific instruments they do
not, therefore, exist seems to be expecting too much
of material means as well as exposing oneself unnecessarily
to criticism on the grounds of extreme
materialistic appetences.</p>

<p>There is indeed need of a more liberal attitude
among men of science towards the world of the unseen.
Intolerance of the data which it offers will for
a time perhaps preserve the aloofness of scientific
dogmatism inviolate but there will most surely come
a reaction against the dogmatism of science and men
will seek freedom and attain it despite their fetters.
Sir <span class="smcap">Oliver Lodge</span>, in his book, the <i>Survival of Man</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
says: "Man's outlook upon the universe is entering
upon a new phase. Simultaneously with the beginning
of a revolutionary increase in his powers of physical
locomotion&mdash;which will soon be extended to a third
dimension and no longer limited to a solid or liquid
surface&mdash;his power of reciprocal mental intercourse is
also in process of being enlarged; for there are signs
that it will some day be no longer limited to contemporary
denizens of earth, but will permit a utilization
of knowledge and powers superior to his own,
even to the extent of ultimately attaining trustworthy
information concerning other conditions of existence."</p>

<p>It is the author's good fortune that he has for a
period extending over several years been able to verify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
the conclusions which Sir <span class="smcap">Oliver Lodge</span> expresses in
the above, and thus to satisfy his own mind that the
process by which man's mental powers are "being enlarged"
is indeed demonstrable by actual observation
and experimental methods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lodge</span> continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The boundary between the two states&mdash;the
known and the unknown, is still substantial, but it
is wearing thin in places, and like excavators engaged
in boring a tunnel from opposite ends amid
the roar of water and other noises, we are beginning
to hear now and again the strokes of the pick-axes
of our comrades on the other side."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Camille Flammarion</span><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> cites 436 cases of psychic
manifestations examined by himself and which
establish beyond any reasonable doubt that there are
certain perceptive faculties, namely, clairvoyance and
clairaudience, that crop out in certain individuals,
sometimes in abnormal conditions and sometimes
normally, the very unusual character of which proves
their rudimentary nature and the potency of their
maturescence in the humanity of the future. Among
the cases cited by <span class="smcap">Flammarion</span> are 186 instances of
manifestations from the dying received by persons
who were awake; 70 cases were manifestations received
by persons asleep; 57 were observations of
direct transmission of thought without the aid of sight,
hearing or touch or other physical means; 49 were
cases of sight at a distance or clairvoyance by persons
awake, in dreams or in somnambulism and 74
cases of premonitory dreams or predictions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
future. Indeed, there are few persons now living who
have not had similar experiences, if not exactly like
these, of the same nature. These examples, of course,
may be greatly multiplied in every country in the
world, and it is unnecessary to enumerate them
further; for, when once the existence of such faculties
has been demonstrated in persons, either in a normal
or an abnormal condition, their presence can no longer
be questioned by the fair-minded. It is, then, only a
question of evolution before they will appear in the
normal way and their universalization, as transmissible
characters, be an accomplished fact. When we
are brought face to face with this sort of phenomenon
which seems to be increasing rapidly the conclusion
is inevitably forced upon us that since evolution must
be a continuous process and matter destined to yield
higher and more refined powers and humanity to come
into a far more extensive scope of motility because
of the opening avenues of knowledge, it is not impossible
that these acuter senses, these new faculties
are now existing in the human race in a rudimentary
stage and are designed to become the universal possession
of all. That this is to be the almost immediate
outcome of the perpetual exalting power which
life exercises not alone over materiality but over
human organs and faculties as well, seems to be the
one big, outstanding implication of the evolutionary
process. The presence of such functions as the ability
to sense the invisible and the inaudible, to answer to
vibrations far subtler than anything in the scope of
our external sense-organs, certainly indicates the existence
of rudimentary faculties which make these
functions possible. <i>Back of these vague, indefinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
functions, back of every supernormal or abnormal
manifestation of man's mentality and back of all that
class of phenomena which take their rise out of supersensuous
areas must lie, in ever increasing potency,
faculties and organs, however rudimentary, which are
the source of these manifestations.</i> Life, that ineluctable
agent of creation, which is incessantly pushing
outward the confines of the intellect's scope of
motility, never wearying, never tiring nor sleeping, has
long ago, in the dim and distant past of man's evolution,
laid the foundations; and in fact, with one stroke
of its creative hand, has molded the organs which are
to become the active media of these new faculties.
And now, these incipient demonstrations, these infantile
struggles which we see now and again outputting
from them, are but the specializing processes
through which, in their later development, these
organs are proceeding. These are the outward signs
which should tell us that life is breaking up these
organs into special parts, assigning to each a certain
division of labor and making of each a perfect coördinate
of all the others. It is, by these very dispread
exhibitions, cutting up, specializing and by slow degrees
determining the function, character and general
tendence of the organs of expression wherewith these
manifestations shall be centralized and put into effective
operation. In doing this, it is but following
its accustomed procedure, the procedure which it
adopted when it produced the eye, the ear, the heart
and the spleen. We shall, therefore, gauge our understanding
of the purport and end of evolution; in
fact, we shall determine our exact intellectual comprehension
of life itself, by the attitude which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
adopt towards it and the mode of its appearance.
Much depends, accordingly, upon the posture which
we assume towards life&mdash;whether we shall say the
totality of life's creative powers has been dissipated
in the bringing of the human body to its present
degree of perfection; whether we shall say that it is
neither necessary nor possible for life to produce
other organs and faculties which shall respond to the
unseen world about us revealing its glories in a way
far more perfect than do our external sense-organs
reveal the wonders of the world of sensation; or,
whether we shall conclude from these most palpable
evidences that life has yet other powers and faculties
which it designs to bestow upon the human mind and
other organs and capabilities with which it shall endow
the human body so that man, in his evolution, shall
be enabled to rise to still higher spheres while yet
incarnate. There may be, and undoubtedly are, those
who, for various reasons prefer to take the former
positions and there are certainly those who like
<span class="smcap">Lodge</span>, <span class="smcap">Flammarion</span>, <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>, <span class="smcap">Crookes</span> and a host
of others, preferring the latter view, would rather
believe in the strength of the great mass of corroborative
testimonies that we are even to-day in the midst
of the matutinal hours of a newer, a better and a
far more efficient era of human evolution than any
through which we have hitherto come.</p>

<p>Already, recent scientific investigations and the
results obtained therefrom have begun to turn the attention
of medical authorities to the activities of two
very small organs situated in the mid-brain and known
as the <i>pineal gland</i> and the <i>pituitary body</i>. These
organs, and especially the <i>pineal gland</i> hitherto sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>posed
to be a vestige of the past, are now beginning
to be recognized as rudimentary organs belonging to
the future evolution of humanity. Dr. <span class="smcap">Charles de
M. Sajous</span>, who is an authority on the <i>pituitary body</i>,
believes that it has no active internal secretions but
is an "epithelio-nervous organ" which controls,
through nerves leading to the adrenals and thyroid
bone, the processes of general oxygenation, metabolism
and nutrition. Little is known of the functions
of the pineal gland except that it is an ovoid, reddish
organ attached to the posterior cerebral commissure
projecting downward and backward between the
anterior pair of the <i>corpora quadrigemina</i>. It is
otherwise known as the "<i>conarium</i>" the "<i>pinus</i>" or
"<i>epiphysis</i>." Situated at the base of the brain, it is
held in position by a fold of the <i>pia mater</i> while its
base is connected with the cerebrum by two pedicles.
It contains amylaceous and gritty, calcareous particles
constituting the brain sand. There are, however,
marked structural resemblances between the <i>pineal
gland</i> and the <i>pituitary body</i> and their formation is
perhaps the most interesting feature of the development
of the <i>thalamencephalon</i> or mid-brain. The
<i>hypophysis cerebri</i> or <i>pituitary body</i> is a small, ovoid,
pale, reddish mass varying in weight from five to ten
grains and situated at the basal extremity of the brain
in a depression of the cranium known as the <i>sella
turcica</i>, a configuration very much like a Turkish
saddle in shape. It is a composite, ductless gland
and consists of two divisions, an anterior and a
posterior, connected by an intermedial portion&mdash;all of
which are attached to the base of the cerebrum by the
<i>infundibulum</i>. The anterior lobe is larger than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
posterior and very vascular, springing in its development
from the buccal cavity of the embryo; the posterior
lobe is situated in a depression of the anterior and
is a brain-process. The <i>pituitary body</i> itself is lodged
in a cavity of the <i>sphenoid</i> bone called the <i>pituitary
fossa</i>. This is a most remarkable position, for the
reason that the <i>sphenoid, or wedge-shaped</i>, bone which
lies at the base of the skull articulates from behind
with the occipital and in front with the <i>frontal</i> and
<i>ethmoid</i> bones and by lateral processes with the
<i>frontal</i>, <i>parietal</i> and <i>temporal</i> bones. From this position
it binds together all the bones of the cranium,
and moreover, articulates with many bones of the face.
It is upon the upper surface of the <i>sphenoid</i> bone
which occupies such a prominent and commanding
position in the cranium, in a deep depression, that the
<i>pituitary gland</i> is located.</p>

<p>Each nasal chamber is lined by a mucous membrane
called the <i>pituitary</i> or <i>Schneiderian</i>. This membrane
is prolonged into the meatuses and air sinuses
which open into the nasal chambers. The <i>pituitary</i>
membrane is thick and soft and diminishes the size
of the meatuses and air sinuses. It is covered by a
ciliated columnar epithelium and contains numerous
racemose glands for the secretion of mucous or
<i>pituita</i>. It is also vascular and the veins which ramify
it have a plexiform or net-work like arrangement. It
divides into two membranes&mdash;a respiratory, which is
concerned in breathing, and an olfactory region. The
respiratory region corresponds to the floor of the nose,
to the inferior turbinated bone and to the lower third
of the nasal septum. The olfactory region is the seat
and distribution of the olfactory nerve and corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>sponds
to the base of the nose, to the superior and
middle turbinals and the upper two-thirds of the nasal
septum.</p>

<p>Recent developments prove that this gland has a
profound influence over the animal economy. It is
believed by some that the <i>pituitary body</i> actually destroys
certain substances which have a toxic influence
on the nervous system; others believe that it secretes
material media for the proper action of the trophic
or nutritive apparatus; still others believe that it influences
blood-pressure. It is known, however, from
experimentation, that its removal in dogs, cats, mice
and guinea pigs causes a fall of temperature, lassitude,
muscular twitchings, dyspn&oelig;a or difficult breathing,
and even speedy death. Hypertrophy of the gland
is directly associated with certain diseases, such as
<i>giantism</i> and <i>acromegaly</i>. The latter is a disease
which causes a general enlargement of the bones of
the head, feet and hands, usually occurring between
the ages of twenty and forty years, and most frequently
in females. The fact that these diseases are so closely
associated with a hypertrophic condition of the
pituitary gland has led to the conclusion that perhaps
the giants or Cyclops of ancient times were cases of
<i>giantism</i> or <i>acromegaly</i>. This view, while interesting
from the standpoint of the functions of the <i>pituitary</i>
gland, is not necessarily a correct one; for the age
of giants, when men attained to a much larger stature
than at present, can be accounted for on other grounds,
namely; that the early mesozoic man, on account of
his having to live among animals, trees and other
vegetation of such huge size, had naturally to be fitted
with a frame proportional to other animals in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
that he might successfully cope with his environing
conditions. Nature thus wisely fitted him for the
conditions which she had prepared for the scenes of
his life.</p>

<p>The facts adduced in the foregoing description are
purely empirical and may be verified by any who seek
to establish their correctness or incorrectness. But
we are about to introduce a species of testimony which
while it may also be verified will not be found so
easy of verification as the above-mentioned physiological
facts, and not by the same means; yet they
are nevertheless deserving of a place here. It is the
liberal attitude that we must adopt towards all
phenomena, excluding none that give promise of the
widening and deepening of our knowledge and an explanation
of much that has seemed heretofore unaccountable.</p>

<p>We have noted how subtle is the physical connection
between these two bodies, the <i>pineal gland</i> and
the <i>pituitary body</i>; we have seen how profound is the
effect which the latter has been demonstrated, in a
measure, to have over the entire bodily economy; but
there is even other testimony to the effect that those
gifted with the inner vision can observe the "pulsating
aura" in each body, a movement which is not unlike
the pulsations of the heart and which never ceases
throughout life. In the development of clairvoyance
it is known that this motion becomes intensified, the
auric vibrations becoming stronger and more pronounced.
The <i>pituitary body</i> is the <i>energizer</i> of the
<i>pineal gland</i> and, as its pulsating arc rises more and
more until it contacts the <i>pineal gland</i>, it awakens and
arouses it into a renewed activity in much the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
manner as current electricity excites nervous tissue.
When the <i>pineal gland</i> is thus aroused clairvoyant perception
is said to become possible. These are facts
which cannot be proved by the materialistic man of
science nor can they be demonstrated to the layman
who has to depend alone upon sense-deliveries for his
knowledge. This is true for the reason that, in the
first place, it is necessary that he shall either feel in
his own mid-brain the energizing activity of these two
organs and have his entire nerve-body shaken from
crown to toe by the down rushing currents of that
subtle energy with which the <i>pituitary body</i> floods it or
be himself the perceiver of its activities. Nevertheless
attention is here called to these phenomena and the
conclusions drawn therefrom are offered as a means of
denoting the probable line of investigations which will
establish the directions which we should pursue and
the source whence we shall find outcropping the new
faculties and their organs of expression.</p>

<p>We confess to a knowledge of the fact that men
of empirical science have long maintained a rather
skeptical, if not contemptuous, attitude towards all
these phenomena but it is also felt that there is far
more of discredit in their attitude than of credit; for,
in so doing, they have voluntarily adopted measures
by means of which the knowledge that they so eagerly
seek is shut out from their attainment. In vain, then,
is appeal made to the intellect to remove the barriers
which it unconsciously interposes between itself
and the goal of its pursuit; in vain do we appeal to
the materialist to give ear to testimony the data of
which cannot be made amenable to his knife and
scalpel neither to the microscope nor microphone; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
sheer vanity is he adjured to look <i>within</i>&mdash;into the interior
of life, of mind and the things which he handles
with his instruments&mdash;for the answers to his queries,
for the path which leads into the wake of life and
consciousness. Because his utter loyalty and devotion
to the <i>modus vivendi</i> of the intellect will not permit
this; but, after all, it is not wholly wise to allure him
away unbetimes from his search after truth through
superficialities nor to inveigle him into giving up his
tenacious prosecution of the physically determinable.
We would not have it so; for, perchance, he, too,
one fine day, in the quiet of his laboratory shall come
upon the data which may substantiate in his own mind
the long settled conclusions of the occultist who, frequently
and not without cause, grows impatient at the
scientist's obstinate delay. These two workers, the
empiricist and the occultist, must ultimately come together
as collaborators&mdash;the one working upon the
form, the vehicle, physical matter and the other seeking
to understand the life, the interior forces which
produce, the creative element. They cannot remain
always aloof from one another; for they, too, are as
men digging a tunnel from opposite ends. Finally,
the partition will break and thus will dawn a new day
for the knowledge of humanity and men will see the
rationale, the truth and good sense of coöperation
in this respect.</p>

<p>It can be said with confidence that whatever in the
future may be learned as to the physiologic functions
of the <i>pituitary body</i> and the <i>pineal gland</i>, it suffices to
know that it is life which they express and that, too,
in a far superior manner than any of the other sense
organs. The <i>modus</i> of these two glands differs in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
very marked way from that of the organs of sight,
hearing, taste, smell and feeling. For these latter are
designed for contact with the external, objective world
of sensations, their growth and evolution being dependent
upon stimuli received from without while with
the former the case is far different, in fact, just the
opposite. The mode of life of the <i>pituitary body</i> and
the <i>pineal gland</i>, instead of receiving sustenance and
impetus from external stimuli, is rather dependent upon
impacts received from the Thinker's own consciousness
and made to impinge upon them by an exclusively
interior process. Situated in the mid-brain, safely
secluded from all external interference, they are
naturally limited to stimuli which come from within, or
it may be said, they are responsive to excitations that
are more spiritual than those which come through the
external sense-organs. If, as has been said they control
the internal processes of metabolism (anabolism
and katabolism), oxygenation, nutrition, and other
important internal movements, none of which can be
said to be under the control of the intellect, is it
not, therefore, justly assumed that their response is
directed towards stimuli which arise interiorly or upon
a plane higher than the intellectual? It is a matter
of scientific knowledge that those persons gifted with
clairvoyance, and commonly known as "sensitives" are
far more responsive to nervous excitation than those
who are not so gifted. This would seem to imply
that, on account of the superactivity of these two
organs, the entire nerve-body has, in consequence, become
more delicately and subtly organized. They
seem to act as a switchboard for the regulation of the
flow of the current of life through the body. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
only do they come more nearly to an adequate expression
of the physiologic function of life, but, as
their energization means an enlargement of the scope
of perception by giving the Thinker's active consciousness
access to hitherto unapproachable realities and by
penetrating the outer mask which life ensouls and also
laying bare a domain of unlimited knowledge the
manifestation of which is far more real than anything
the senses can disclose, it is evident that they constitute,
in their collaborative functions, a more highly adaptable
medium for the expression of the Thinker's consciousness.
And if so, for the kosmic consciousness
which is the source of all forms of consciousness, they
furnish a specializing and <i>adaptizing</i> agency.</p>

<p>Now, in all those cases of inspirations, revelations,
telepathic communications, clairaudience, clairvoyance,
dreams, visions, etc., wherein the Thinker is enabled
to perceive facts and verities which are then presented
to his consciousness in a manner clearly without the
province of the common sense-organs, it must be apparent
that these manifestations are apprehended by
a perceptual mechanism which is entirely independent
of external sense presentations but which is an interior
and subtler form of psychic activity. Sounds which
are heard by so-called "sensitives" and objects which
are perceived by eyes that are keener than those organs
said to have been evolved from the "medusa" cannot
be heard by other persons nor perceived by them in
any way. Thus it would seem that there are inner
organs of perception which respond to these finer
vibrations and which enable the person so gifted to
apprehend them.</p>

<p>There are those who, presumably basing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
assertions upon actual observation and knowledge, unqualifiedly
assert that in order "to gain contact with
the inner worlds all that remains to be done is the
awakening of the <i>pituitary body</i> and the <i>pineal gland</i>.
When this is accomplished man will again possess
the faculty of perception in the higher worlds, but
on a grander scale than formerly (when humanity was
in its infancy and exercised a lower form of psychic
power only); because it will be in connection with the
voluntary nervous system, and therefore, under the
control of the will. Through this inner perceptive
faculty all avenues of knowledge will be opened to
him and he will have at his service a means of acquiring
information compared with which all other
methods of investigation are but child's play."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It is
the lack of this ability to see, with our physical eyes,
as it were, by the "Roentgen rays," to penetrate
the inwardness of things that has baffled and confounded
men for so long a time and which has
eventually led certain mathematicians and others to
conjecture such strange, and in many cases, illogical
possibilities for the denizens of four-space. This inability
together with the desire to fathom the innermost
complexities of solids and to handle, albeit with
unholy hands, the supersensuous, the mysterious and
the unapproachable identity of "things-in-themselves"
have induced the more zealous among them to contrive
some kind of hypothesis which would, at least,
offer an explanation of these phenomena. It has
driven them to wrestle with metaphysical possibilities
in a vain endeavor to grasp that which, <i>ignis-fatuus</i>
like, ever evades their slightest intellectual approach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
But why this prolonged struggle, why this intellectual
maneuvering and sophistry? "We can calculate,
compute, excogitate," says <span class="smcap">Paul Carus</span>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> "and describe
all the characteristics of four-dimensional space,
so long as we remain in the realm of abstract thought
and do not venture to make use of our motility and
execute our plans in an actualized construction of
motion; but as soon as we make an <i>a priori</i> construction
of the scope of our motility, we find out
the incompatibility of the whole scheme." Thus
mathematicians are forced to relinquish all hopes of
transforming the world of life into a sort of four-space
dwelling place where everything is done according
to the laws of mathematics. But whether they
shall accept it or not there is a wider, truer and more
rational view which recognizes all metageometrical
investigations, as well as all kindred phenomena, as
universal evidences indeed, as the very causes which,
in the future humanity, will actually awaken and
cause to be accelerated in their development these
little inner sense-organs, the <i>pineal gland</i> and the
<i>pituitary body</i>, whose perfect development promises
to provide for the Thinker's consciousness an avenue
of expression such as humanity has possessed never
before. And too, it is not without full knowledge of
the fact that it has been customary, among certain
scientists or perhaps all of them, to regard these
bodies, at least the <i>pineal gland</i>, as vestigal organs
belonging to the past of human evolution, that we
make these assertions. Yet, as man proceeds in the
perfection of mechanical science, in the development
of instruments of precision that aid his external senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
responds more and more to the subtle vibrations teeming
everywhere in the atmosphere about him, and
comes, in the course of time, naturally to possess a
more sensitively keyed nervous mechanism, a finer
body and higher spiritual aspirations, there will be
a corresponding widening of his scope of vision and
the attainment of larger powers of perception which
must inevitably, in the very nature of things, tend
towards a deeper and truer knowledge.

In view of the foregoing, it is believed that the
general results of this pituitarial awakening which
may be expected as humanity continues to evolve
should be seen in the marked effects which will be
wrought in the entire metabolistic area of the human
body whereby a gradual intensification and sensitization
of the whole neural mechanism will raise the
peculiar efficiency of all the senses whether purely
physiologic or psychic. For there are undoubtedly
notes so delicate in their intensity that they transcend
the grasp of the audital nerves; scents and fragrances
so subtle in their excelling purity that it is beyond the
powers of our present olfactorial contrivances to detect
them; colors and other external stimuli so sublimely
supersensuous that a nervous mechanism perhaps
ten-fold more delicate and responsive than ours
is required to apprehend them. All these, and more
than at present is conceivable, will come, with the
aid of pituitarial stimulation, within the purview of
a more highly developed humanity of the future. And
because mathematics have led a movement into the
very camp of the intellectuals&mdash;logic-bound and
tethered by the severest rigors of mathesis&mdash;whereby
the intolerant intellect has been compelled, by rules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
of its own making, to recognize the existence of the
supersensuous, and by looking into the glaring light
of the sun of the intuitable to gain strength of vision
and boldness to press forward, a great and far-reaching
service has been wrought for humanity. And
in the tower of hyperspace mathematics have erected
a monument to the intellect which, as long as the
human race remains, will mark the great turning point
in man's path to the highest life.</p>

<p>What if it were possible that the scientist, when
he had carried instruments to their utmost precision
and penetration, should suddenly, or otherwise, be
endowed with a clear-perceptivity of sight, hearing and
smell, so that he could with his own powers of vision,
feeling and hearing take up the task where the microscope,
the microphone and the micrometer left off
and delve into depths far too unfathomable for his
appliances, perceiving the innermost realities of
things and processes? What if it were possible for
him, with these added powers, to see and examine
without the aid of the magnifying lens the electron,
the atom and the molecule? What if the cell, the
bacterium, and other invisible forms of life would
then deliver up their secrets to his knowing mind?
What if he could sense with his own inner vision, the
ultra-violet and the infra-red rays; what indeed, if
spirit itself, the innermost sheath of life, should be
visible and palpable to him and he could note the
internal processes, the action and movements of the
infinitesimals of life? Think you not that such direct
contact, such immediate and incontrovertible knowledge
would be far superior to any advantage which
his manufactured devices now bestow? It is even so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus will react upon man's perceptive apparatus
the flood of light which the awakened intuition will
shed upon them and thus will man rise higher, driven
on by the current of life with the mass of materiality,
to a point of complete spiritualization and take additional
steps in that direction which leads to Raja Yoga
or the Royal Union with the divine life of the universe.</p>

<p>Before this step is taken, however, and before the
passage from mechanics to biogenetics is made, as
made it must be, man must win a complete mastery
over matter. But this he will do; for more and more
he is learning to put all those forms of labor which
are so exacting as to leave him no time for the
development of his higher powers into the hands of
machinery. He will not be free until he has done this
well-nigh completely. This is the task of the intellect
and with it man must win his way to these higher
faculties which are destined to succeed the intellect
whereupon he will be ushered out of a life bound and
restricted by mechanics to a life of unimaginable freedom,
the <i>intuitive life</i>.</p>

<p>The outcome of these new faculties of perception
and the development of the intuition will be the springing
up of a new species of art that, turning away
from appearances and sinking beneath or rising above,
superficialities, will seek to portray in newly found
colors, the plastic essence of things so that we shall
have an art which pertains to the real, superseding
that which pertains to the phenomenal. Language
and the need of it will pass away; for man will have
outgrown the use of signs and symbols in his communion
with his fellows and will use the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
the intuition&mdash;direct and instantaneous cognition.
Philosophy will be regenerated, re-created. Speculation
will give way to truth and there shall be but one
philosophy and that shall be the <i>knowledge of the real</i>.
Mathematics, the royal insignia of the intellectual life,
because it can deal only with immobilities, with segments
and parts and has no aptitude for the continuous
flow, will yield its kingdom to a higher form of
kinetics which will serve the intuitive faculty as mathematics
now serve the intellect. Science will then be
no longer empirical in its method; but a system of
direct and incontrovertible truths. Religion will rise
to meet these changes which will come in the path of
human evolution; and faith will surrender its place to
knowledge. Ethics, recast in a new mold, will deal
with the new aspect of man's relation to his fellowmen.
Man, for whose highest good these ultimate
changes will come, will be a new creature, a higher
and better man; and humanity shall evolve a new
race. There shall, indeed, be "a new heaven and a
new earth."</p>

the famous old <i>Encyclopedia</i> edited by <span class="smcap">Diderot</span> and himself on
<i>Dimension</i>. In this article the idea of the fourth dimension is
dwelt upon at length. The view which he expressed in this article,
of course, served greatly to popularize the conception among the
learned men of the day, and owing to the close relationship existing
between <span class="smcap">D'Alembert</span> and <span class="smcap">La Grange</span>, it is not surprising that
the latter should have been very much enamored of the idea.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
